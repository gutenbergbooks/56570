<h1>Breaking Into the Movies</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="indent">Were the average man suddenly called upon to
assemble all the women in his town who looked like
Mary Pickford, he might find himself at a loss as to
how to commence. In fact, he might even doubt that
there were sufficient persons answering this description
to warrant such a campaign.</p>

<p class="indent">We know a way to get them all together on twenty-four
hours&#39; notice. Just insert a small advertisement
in the local newspaper, reading:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wanted for the movies&mdash;a girl who looks like Mary
Pickford&mdash;apply at such-and-such a studio to-morrow
morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">We guarantee that not only will every woman who
looks like Mary Pickford be on the spot at sunrise, but
that a large preponderance of the entire female population
will drop in during the morning. For it is a
puzzling but indisputable fact that everybody wants to
break into the movies.</p>

<p class="indent">The curious part of it all is that the movies really
need these people.</p>

<p class="indent">On the one hand are countless men and women besieging
the studio doors in the hope of starting a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
career in any one of a thousand capacities, from actress
to scenario writer, from director to cameraman. There
are people with plots, people with inventions, people
with new ideas of every conceivable variety, all clamoring
for admission. And, on the other hand, there are
the men who manage the movies sending out all manner
of exhortations, appeals and supplications to just such
people to come and work in their studios. They drown
each other&#39;s voices, the one calling for new talent
and new types, the many for a chance to demonstrate
that they are just the talent and types that are so in
demand.</p>

<p class="indent">This economic paradox, this passing in the night
of Demand and Supply, has come about through a general
misconception of everything concerned with the
movies.</p>

<p class="indent">The first to be in the wrong were the producers.
They built up an industry which, in its early days,
was vitally dependent upon individual personalities. A
picture, according to their views, was made or unmade
by a single star or director or writer, and very naturally
they were loath to entrust the fate of a hundred thousand
dollar investment to untried hands. While on the
one hand they realized the pressing need for new blood
in their industry, they were, nevertheless, very wary
of being the first to welcome the newcomer. Producers
preferred to pay twenty times the price to experienced
professionals, no matter how mediocre their work
might have been in the past, than to take a chance on
a promising beginner. The business side of the movies,
has, in the past, been nothing more nor less than a
tremendous gamble wherein the men who had staked
their fortunes on a single photoplay walked about in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
fear of their very shadows&mdash;desiring new ideas, yet
afraid to risk testing them, calling for new artists yet
fearing to give them the opportunity to break in. The
very nature of the industry was responsible for this
situation and, to a large extent, it is a condition which
still prevails in a majority of the smaller studios. The
greatest obstacle which every beginner must surmount
is the one which first confronts him&mdash;the privilege of
doing his first picture&mdash;the first chance.</p>

<p class="indent">The larger companies, however, in the last year
or so have awakened to the fact that by excluding beginners
they have themselves raised the cost of motion
picture production many times. They have found
themselves with a very limited number of stars and
directors and writers and technical men to choose from,
all of whom, for this very reason, could demand
enormous salaries. One by one these companies are
instituting various systems for the encouragement of
embryo talent. Now, if ever, is the time to break
into the movies.</p>

<p class="indent">But much more to blame for the general mix-up in
the movies are the beginners themselves. In the majority
of cases they state in loud, penetrating accents
that they desire to break into the movies, here and
now; but when questioned as to the exact capacity in
which they desire to accomplish this ambition, they
appear to be a bit hazy. Anything with a large salary
and short hours will do, they say. The organization
of the business and the sordid details connected with
the various highly specialized jobs in the studios concern
them not at all. They let it go with an unqualified
statement that they want to break in the worst way&mdash;and
generally they do.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
Now making movies is not child&#39;s play. It is a profession&mdash;or
rather a combination of professions&mdash;which
takes time and thought and study. True, there
are fortunes to be made for those who will seriously
enter this field and study their work as they would
study for any other profession. But unfortunately,
most of those who head towards the cinema studios
do not take time to learn the facts about the industry.
They do not look over the multitude of different highly
specialized positions which the movies offer and ask
themselves for which one they are best suited. They
just plunge in, so intent upon making money at the
moment that they give no thought at all to the future.</p>

<p class="indent">Therefore, in writing this series, we shall start
with an old saw&mdash;a warning to amateurs to look before
they leap. No industry in the world presents so
many angles, varying from technical work in the studio,
to the complexities of high finance. If you really
wish to break into the movies, go to the studios and
see for yourself what you are fitted for. Perhaps you
think you are an actor, and are really a first rate
scenarioist. Perhaps you have an ambition to plan scenery,
and instead find that your forte lies in the business
office. Men who started as cameramen are now
directors. Men who started as directors have ended
as highly successful advertising managers. So there
you are. You pay your money&mdash;and&mdash;if you are wise&mdash;you
take your choice.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
WHAT THE JOBS ARE</h2>

<p class="indent">Most people seem to think there are concerned in
the making of motion pictures just four classes of people&mdash;actors,
scenario writers, directors and cameramen.
It all seems very simple. The scenario writer sits down
in the morning and works out a scene; he wakes up
the director, who packs some actors and a cameraman
in an automobile, together with a picnic lunch, and
goes out to make the picture on some lovely hillside.
Then, having finished the photoplay, they take it
around to your local theater and exhibit it at twenty-five
cents a seat.</p>

<p class="indent">As a matter of fact, the movies, now the fifth national
industry in the United States, has as many
phases, and as many complexities as any other industry
in the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Broadly speaking, the movies are made up of alliances
between producing companies and distributing
companies. For example, the Constance Talmadge
Corporation produces the photoplays in which Miss
Talmadge is starred, and this Company is allied with
the First National Exhibitors Circuit which takes the
completed film and sells it to theater managers in every
part of the world. The Constance Talmadge Corporation&#39;s
duty is to make a photoplay and deliver it to the
First National Exhibitors Circuit; the latter company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
duplicates the film in hundreds of &quot;prints,&quot; advertises
it, rents it to exhibitors, and sees to the delivery of the
film. In the same way, Nazimova makes comedies and
releases them through the Metro Corporation, her distributor.</p>

<p class="indent">The great distributing companies employ the salesmen,
advertising experts, business men, and so forth.
All the technical work concerned with the making of
the picture, however, is in the hands of the producing
company, and, since we are engaged in such work ourselves,
it is about these posts that we must talk.</p>

<p class="indent">If we are to take the studio jobs in their natural
order, the first to begin work on a picture is, of course,
the author. Each studio employs a scenario editor
who is on the lookout for good magazine stories or
plays or original scripts. He himself is not so much
a writer as an analyst, who knows what kind of stories
his public wants; generally he is an old newspaperman
or an ex-magazine editor. Having bought the story,
he turns it over to a scenarioist&mdash;the &quot;continuity
writer.&quot; This type of specialist is much in demand,
since no story can survive a badly constructed scenario.</p>

<p class="indent">The scenario writer puts the story into picture form
exactly as a dramatist may put a novel into play form
for the stage. It is the scenarioist or continuity writer
who really gives to the story its screen value&mdash;hence
the very large prices paid for this work when it is well
done. Next in line is the director, who takes the
scenario and sets out to make the picture.</p>

<p class="indent">There is a shortage of directors at present, and for
that reason, salaries are particularly high in this line,
but of course, direction is a profession which takes
many years of study.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
In beginning work on his picture, the director first
consults the studio manager, who is really the head of
the employment office. The studio manager consults
with him as to the expenses of the scenery and the
length of time to be spent in making the picture and
then summons the technical staff.</p>

<p class="indent">The technical staff of a studio is a rather large assembly.
There is the art director, who plans the scenery,
the technical man who directs the building, the
casting director, who selects the actors, the electrician,
who assists in working out the lighting effects, the
laboratory superintendent, who must supervise the developing
of the film, the cutters, who assemble the completed
film, and last, but not least, the cameraman.
Of course there are hundreds of minor posts&mdash;assistant
director, assistant cameraman, property man, research
experts, location seekers, and so forth.</p>

<p class="indent">The casting director immediately sends out a call
for the &quot;types&quot; demanded in the scenario. If possible,
he notifies the actors and actresses personally, but more
often he is forced to get in touch with them through
the numerous agencies which act as brokers in &quot;types.&quot;
The Actors&#39; Equity Association is now doing excellent
work in supplying actors for pictures at the lowest possible
cost to the actor in the way of commissions. Presently
a large number of actors and actresses appear
at the studio and the casting director selects from them
the individuals best suited to the coming production.
Beginners are warned against grafting agents who on
any pretense whatever charge more than the legal 5%
commission. They are also warned against signing
&quot;exclusion&quot; contracts with any agent, as this frequently
compels the actor to pay double commissions.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
Meanwhile the art director has built his scenery, and
the picture goes &quot;into production.&quot; At the end of some
six weeks or two months, the directors turn the completed
film over to the assembling and cutting department.
As a rule both the director and the scenario
writer work with the assembler and cutter, and if they
are wise, they insist on doing the cutting themselves,
for the success of the picture depends largely upon this
important operation of assembly. At the same time,
another specialist designs and works out the illustrations
on the borders of the written inserts. Finally the
assembled picture is shown to the studio staff, and if
they are satisfied, the negative is forwarded to the distributing
company. The studio&#39;s work on that picture
is ended.</p>

<p class="indent">From this brief survey, you can see that the avenues
for breaking into the movies are almost unlimited.
You can be an actor, director, cameraman, scene builder,
cutter, titler, scenario writer, or anything else if you
will begin at the bottom and learn the game. All of
these positions are highly paid and all require a high
knowledge of motion picture technique.</p>

<p class="indent">The important thing is to <i>start</i>&mdash;to get into the
studio, in any capacity. Then choose the type of work
in which you desire to rise, and learn it. Everybody
will help you and encourage you if you start this way,
instead of trying the more common but less successful
method of starting at the top and working down.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
ACTING FOR THE SCREEN</h2>

<p class="indent">In New York resides a dramatic critic, now on the
staff of a great newspaper, who has his own ideas
about movie acting. The idea in question is that there
is no such thing as movie acting&mdash;and the gentleman
carries it out by refusing to allow the word &quot;acting&quot;
to be printed in any of the notices and reviews in his
newspaper. When he wishes to convey the thought
that such and such a star acted in such and such a
picture he says, &quot;Miss So-and-So posed before the
camera in the motion picture.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now this critic is a good critic, as critics go, but
he would be improved physically and mentally by a set
of those monkey glands which the medicos are so successfully
grafting upon various ossified personalities.
Anyone who thinks that there is no such thing as
motion picture acting is probably still wondering
whether the Germans will win the war. Motion picture
acting is a highly developed art, with a technique
quite as involved as that of the legitimate stage.</p>

<p class="indent">The fundamental principle to remember in undertaking
screen acting is that the camera demands far
greater realism on the part of the actor than the eyes
of an audience. An actor in the spoken drama nearly
always overplays or underplays his part. If he recited
the same lines in the same tone with the same gestures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
in real life, he would appear to be just a little bit
spiffy, as they say in English drinking circles. On the
stage it is necessary to overdraw the character in order
to convey a realistic impression to the audience; exact
naturalism on the stage would appear as unreal as an
unrouged face under a spotlight.</p>

<p class="indent">The camera, however, demands absolute realism.
Actors must act as naturally and as leisurely as they
would in their own homes. Their expressions must
be no more pronounced than they would be in real
life. Above all, they must be absolutely unconscious
of the existence of the camera.</p>

<p class="indent">Any deviation from this course leads to the most
mortifying results on the screen. The face, enlarged
many times life size, becomes clearly that of an actor,
rather than a real character. The assumed expression
of hate or fear which would seem so natural on the
stage is merely grotesque in the film. Unless the
actor is really <i>thinking</i> the things he is trying to portray
on the screen, the audience becomes instantly
aware that something is wrong.</p>

<p class="indent">In the same way the camera picks up and accentuates
every motion on the part of the actor. An unnecessary
gesture is not noticed on the stage. On the
screen, enlarged many times, it is instantly noted.</p>

<p class="indent">The two most important rules to follow, then, in
motion picture acting are: act as you would under
the same circumstances in real life, and eliminate all
movement and gesture which does not bear on the
scene. It is better not to move at all than to make a
false move.</p>

<p class="indent">Beginners must adjust their walk to the camera.
There is no rule for this, however, as every individual&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
way of standing and walking is different. Only
through repeated tests can the beginner discover and
correct the defects which are sure to appear in his
physical pose the first time he acts before a camera.</p>

<p class="indent">Often in making a picture, the director will instruct
his cast to &quot;speed up&quot; or &quot;slow down&quot; their scene.
Sometimes, also, he will alter the tempo of the scene
by slowing down or speeding up the rate at which the
camera is being cranked. Beginners must follow such
instructions to the letter, for the timing of a scene is
a vitally important part of picture production and a
duty which is entirely in the hands of the director.</p>

<p class="indent">The best way to learn the principles of motion picture
acting is to watch the making of as many scenes
as possible before attempting to act one. Most of the
stars of to-day learned their art by watching the efforts
of others before the camera. Only by constant observation
in the studio and, more important, in real
life, where the actions and reactions of real people
can be noted, can an actor hope to become proficient.

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
WOULD YOU FILM WELL?</h2>

<p class="indent">Probably the number of people who have not at
one time or another wondered in a sneaking sort of
way if they wouldn&#39;t look pretty well on the screen
is limited to the aborigines of Africa. And, believe
it or not, two of the aborigines themselves applied
at our studio for jobs not long ago. They had acted
in several travelogue pictures, taken in darkest Africa,
had traveled as porters with the company to the coast,
and had finally become so enamored of the work that
they &quot;beat&quot; their way all the way to America, with an
English vocabulary limited to about fifty words,
twenty-five of which were highly profane. It just goes
to show that we are all human. Needless to say, both
beauty and character are the characteristics in demand
in the films, as everywhere else. The curious fact is
that faces which in real life possess great beauty or
deep character, frequently fail to carry this across to
the camera.</p>

<p class="indent">The chief reason for this lies in the fact that the
camera does not accept color values, and at the same
time accentuates many defects which are ordinarily
imperceptible to the eye. For example, a wonderful
type of Italian beauty appeared at our studio while
we were casting &quot;Mama&#39;s Affair&quot; for Constance Talmadge.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
She had never before appeared in motion
pictures, and our casting director was quick to seize
the opportunity to make a test of her face. When
the picture was shown, her extraordinarily fine coloring
of course went for nothing, and her beauty was
entirely marred by the inexplicable appearance of a
fine down over her upper lip and a large mole on her
left temple. Both the mole and the down had been
entirely unnoticed in daylight, but under the fierce
mercury lights of the studio and the enlarging lenses
they made her face grotesque. At another time we
attempted to make a leading man of a famous war
hero. This boy had been a college athlete and had
subsequently distinguished himself as a bayonet fighter
on four battlefields. When his test films were projected,
to the astonishment of everyone he appeared as
an an&aelig;mic, effeminate stripling, whose every gesture
aroused the ridicule of the audience.</p>

<p class="indent">The skin of the face must be entirely smooth and
unbroken. The slightest eruption or blemish is visible
on the screen, especially in this day when &quot;close-ups&quot;
are the vogue. The teeth must be perfect.</p>

<p class="indent">Considerations which do not matter in the slightest
degree in facial beauty on the screen are those of
coloring and of fineness of the features. The pinker
a woman&#39;s cheeks may be, the hollower they appear
to the camera, for red photographs as black, and a
face which is beautiful, but coarse in its outline, frequently
photographs quite as well as the beautiful face
which is exquisite in every detail.</p>

<p class="indent">A screen star should be equally beautiful in every
expression and from every angle. This is not so true
of the stage star, for when she is moving about, speaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
and gesticulating, the question of her beauty becomes
comparatively unimportant. On the screen,
however, important scenes are always taken in &quot;close-ups&quot;
wherein the star, whether portraying rage or
pain, love or hate, must be equally charming, at the
risk of making a permanently bad impression upon
her audience.</p>

<p class="indent">Many people who are beautiful when seen in &quot;full
face&quot; are most unattractive in profile. In fact, the
matter narrows down still further, for quite often
those who have a lovely profile are, for some inexplicable
reason, gross and unattractive when the face is
turned to show three-quarters. A number of the
present movie stars have risen to the top despite such
impediments by stipulating in all their contracts that
they be never shown in close-up in the pose in which
they are unattractive. One star in particular never
shows the left side of her face for this reason. This,
however, is obviously a great handicap.</p>

<p class="indent">The male types which are most in demand are not
those whose appeal is through physical beauty. Audiences
are sick of large-eyed, romantic heroes, and are
demanding a little manly force and character in their
heroes.</p>

<p class="indent">To film well, a man&#39;s head should be large, rugged,
with the features cut in masses, like a Rodin bust.
Whether he is attempting to play &quot;juveniles,&quot; &quot;leads&quot;
or &quot;heavies&quot; his face must possess the cardinal requisites
of character. Deep-set eyes, a strong chin, a
jutting forehead, a prominent nose, are all desirable.
Again, the high cheekbones and long face appear desirable
characteristics. William S. Hart&#39;s success depends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
largely on these two simple characteristics of
facial structure.</p>

<p class="indent">Neither in men nor in women is the hair an essential
for screen beauty. Wigs and trick arrangements of
the hair are a function of the make-up department,
and a man or woman with no hair at all could still
be made to appear most attractive to the unsophisticated
camera.</p>

<p class="indent">In analyzing your own face, then, ask yourself the
following questions:</p>

<p class="indent">Are my eyes large?</p>

<p class="indent">Is my skin fine and well kept?</p>

<p class="indent">Is my mouth small and are my teeth good?</p>

<p class="indent">Is my nose straight?</p>

<p class="indent">Has my face character, something which makes it
not only beautiful, but which portrays the underlying
personality?</p>

<p class="indent">If you can answer these questions in the affirmative
you may have a career before you in the motion pictures.
If you cannot answer any of them but the last
in the affirmative, you may still be successful as a
movie actor, for &quot;types&quot;&mdash;whether of gunmen or millionaires,
villains or saints&mdash;are much in demand. One
man has made himself a small fortune by playing
parts in which a particularly villainous expression
were required&mdash;such as dope fiends. Another chap,
in the Western studios, has made a good living
for years by acting &quot;stained glass saints,&quot; having
been equipped by nature with an unusually &aelig;sthetic
expression.</p>

<p class="indent">In any case, if you are to essay a career in the
movies, remember that your natural characteristics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
are all that count. Tricks of rolling the eyes or
puckering the lips or setting the jaw are buncombe
and are instantly discovered by the camera.</p>

<p class="indent">Be natural. Keep healthy and happy. That, in the
movies, as in real life, is the way to charm and beauty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
MAKE-UP</h2>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">
<img class="border" src="images/gs03.jpg" width="700" height="423" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rouging the Lips for the Camera</span></p>
<p>Red photographs black, so particular care must be taken in rouging the lips for movie work.
John Emerson is helping May Collins with her make-up, while Anita Loos and the director,
Victor Fleming, give suggestions.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Although most women use cosmetics in their every-day
life, they are lamentably ignorant of the principles
of make-up. For example, not one woman in a hundred
knows that she should never rouge her face until
she has put on her hat, since the shadow and line of
the hat changes the whole color and composition of
her face. The average man&#39;s knowledge of the subject
is limited to the use of powder after shaving.
And yet thousands of men and women secure work
in the mob and ensemble scenes in the movies and
find themselves expected to make up for the camera,
the most difficult task of all, with no previous instruction
whatsoever. No wonder they are discouraged
when they see themselves peering out from the crowd
scene with a face they hardly recognize themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, almost all the stars of to-day&mdash;Norma
Talmadge, Constance Talmadge, Mary Pickford, and
dozens of others&mdash;have risen from these mob scenes.
Their faces, even when seen among hundreds of
others, attracted instant attention. Perhaps it was
natural beauty. Perhaps, too, they had, by accident or
design, solved at the start the great problem which
confronts all movie actors, that of finding the correct
make-up.</p>

<p class="indent">Movie make-up strives only for a photographic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
effect and has no relation to street or stage make-up.
Almost every face contains numerous imperfections
which are invisible to the eye, yet which, when enlarged
many times on the screen, are very obvious.
There are fundamental rules of make-up, but the only
way to perfect your technique is by constantly viewing
your own &quot;stills&quot; and movies, and changing your
make-up to the best advantage.</p>

<p class="indent">Red photographs black, and for this reason rouge
is little used in the studios, except for special effects.
Rouge on the cheeks gives the illusion of dark shadows
and makes the face look hollow; it deepens the eyes,
and is sometimes used on the eyelids for this reason.
Light carmen may be used on the lips.</p>

<p class="indent">To start your make-up you will need cold cream,
special yellow film powder, film grease paint, and a
soft towel. Massage your face with cold cream and
then remove it with the towel, so that the surface is
absolutely clean. Then apply your grease paint with
the fingers, and cover every bit of the face from the
collar-line to the hair.</p>

<p class="indent">When you have a smooth, even surface of grease
paint, spread special film powder upon it and pat it in
lightly with a powder puff. There are a number of
shades of grease paint and by changing the grease
tint before applying the powder you can darken or
lighten your complexion in accordance with your part.
Before going further, make sure there are no blotches
on your make-up&#39;s surface and that the grease has
left no sheen.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">
<img class="border" src="images/gs04.jpg" width="700" height="420" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Making Up the Eyes</span></p>
<p>The eyes are the most expressive of the features and their make-up is correspondingly important.
Here John Emerson and Anita Loos are helping Basil Sydney, the noted English
actor, to darken his eyes in accordance with movie technique.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The eyes are the most important and expressive features.
The make-up which relates to them is all important.
First you must ascertain by actual test the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
correct color with which to line your eyes. Almost
every color is used, for the effect seems to vary with
different faces. Black, blue, green, brown and red are
all used in varying proportions and mixtures by different
actors. Naturally, you should try to find the color
which makes your eyes look deepest and most
luminous.</p>

<p class="indent">The edge of the upper eyelid is clearly lined. Then
the shade is worked back toward the eyebrow, getting
constantly lighter, until it finally blends with the grease
paint of the face. The process is reversed for the
lower lid, which is darkest at the edge and grows
lighter as you work down.</p>

<p class="indent">Your eyelids should be lined with black cosmetic.
Do not bead them. This shows clearly in close-ups
and looks rather ridiculous. The slapstick comedy
people sometimes use beaded eyelids to burlesque the
&quot;baby-doll&quot; expression.</p>

<p class="indent">The corners of the eyes are shadowed with brown
or red. It is this shadowing that gives most of the
character to the eyes; but at the same time it is apt
to age the whole face. For this reason it must be done
in conjunction with actual tests.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally, apply light carmen to your lips and make
sure you do not overdo it.</p>

<p class="indent">There are numerous special recipes for producing
pallor, scars, bruises, and the like. Blackface make-up
is done most successfully with charred cork dust mixed
with water to produce a heavy paste. Tom Wilson,
the best known player of negro parts in the movies,
who played in &quot;The Birth of a Nation,&quot; and more recently
in our own special production, &quot;Red Hot Romance,&quot;
advises amateurs to use this recipe and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
further, to high-light the natural lines of their faces
by scraping off the cork with a sharp stick, wherever
a line is to show, and letting the natural white of
the skin appear.</p>

<p class="indent">High-lighting for most character parts is a special
art. Such characters as Indian faces or the weather-beaten
and wrinkled countenance of an old sea captain
may be done in brown with white high-lights.
You should ask your cameraman to help you with
high-lighting, as it is very difficult.</p>

<p class="indent">There are tricks of make-up which alter the entire
character of the face. For example, by shading the
outline of the face with red you can make it appear
much thinner. In this case the grease paint is slightly
reddened&mdash;or, if you desire, darkened&mdash;near the ear-line.
If you desire to make your face rounder and
fuller reverse the process and lighten the grease paint
at its outer edge.</p>

<p class="indent">If your eyebrows and hair are dark, you can tinge
them gray by rubbing the hair with mascaro and then
combing. If they are light, white and black grease
paint, applied alternately and then combed, will do
the trick. Beards and bushy eyebrows are made of
cr&ecirc;pe hair and glued on with spirit gum. As a matter
of fact, if you are really serious about making a
career of movie acting, it is best to grow, so far as
possible, the hirsute appendages required in your parts.
For an unshaven tramp or a Robinson Crusoe effect,
for example, it is much better to go unshaven for a
week or so than to produce a false effect by attempting
to imitate the real thing with cr&ecirc;pe hair.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">
<img class="border" src="images/gs05.jpg" width="700" height="417" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Glueing on a Cr&ecirc;pe Hair Mustache.</span></p>
<p>John Emerson is affixing a villainous mustache to Frank Stockdale. Spirit gum and cr&ecirc;pe
hair are used.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Finally, lest you be left in the position of the man
who starts his first ride on a motorcycle without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
knowing how to shut the power off, we may add that
all this nasty mess of grease paint and powder and
gum and hair will come off in an instant when cold
cream is applied. It is hard to feel natural in make-up
at first; but presently you will forget that you have
it on at all.</p>

<p class="indent">All of the necessary cosmetics may be secured
through any drug store or theatrical costumer. If
you want to find out how you will look in the movies,
it is not necessary to have a film test made. Just
buy some make-up and have someone take a few
&quot;close-ups&quot; of your head with an ordinary camera.
But do not retouch the negatives&mdash;for movies are not
retouched, you know.</p>

<p class="indent">Look for imperfections of every sort in pose and
expression. Then try to find a make-up which will
eradicate them. If you solve your make-up problem
before you go to the studio you will be well repaid.
Among the dozens of flat, uninteresting countenances
a well made-up face stands out and attracts the attention
of the director at once.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
HOW TO DRESS FOR A PICTURE</h2>

<p class="indent">There is only one drawback to the pleasurable life
of the movie actor or actress. They draw big salaries;
they get their names in the papers and are deluged
with &quot;fan&quot; letters to such an extent that special postal
departments are installed in their offices; the work is
interesting and the hours comparatively short. But,
alas, they have to have a lot of clothes.</p>

<p class="indent">To be sure, the buying of clothes is a most pleasurable
experience to all women and to many men. And,
forsooth, if they draw big salaries, why cavil about
the cost of replenishing a wardrobe every now and
again?</p>

<p class="indent">The fact is, the wardrobes are not replenished every
now and again; they are constantly in a state of replenishment,
and for that reason the average actor&#39;s
bank account, no matter how big the salary, is also in
constant need of being similarly replenished. For
every new scene is apt to require completely new
gowns and suits, and, in the case of the actors who
play the more important parts, no two suits or gowns
can be worn in any two pictures or the fans will be
sure to discover it and write uncomplimentary letters
to the studio.</p>

<p class="indent">In the case of the beginner, however, no such expenses
need be met if he or she has one complete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
wardrobe to start with. People playing minor characters
must dress for the part at their own expense,
but no one notices or cares whether they wear the
same clothes with which they recently graced the
studio next door. If they play a part requiring a special
dress or uniform the management will supply it
without charge.</p>

<p class="indent">It is rather difficult for a newcomer to the movies
to know exactly what clothes are required for their
wardrobe. Therefore we are including the following
comments on clothes and styles, as applied to motion
picture work:</p>

<p class="indent">Men should have at least three business suits, one
of which should be light and one dark.</p>

<p class="indent">For summer scenes, white flannels, with a blue coat
and a soft shirt&mdash;<i>not</i> a sport shirt&mdash;are required.
White duck shoes complete this outfit. Tweed suits
are the proper thing for wear in the country club
scenes and in most pictures calling for scenes on English
estates.</p>

<p class="indent">For dress wear three outfits are necessary. There is
the cutaway for afternoon weddings, society teas, and
so forth, a Tuxedo for club scenes and semi-dress occasions,
and finally, full dress for balls and dinners where
ladies are in the scene. A dark four-in-hand or bow
tie, with a stand-up or wing collar, should be worn
with the cutaway, and regulation dress bow ties, black
with the dinner coat and white with the dress suit.
These clothes are an essential part of a motion picture
actor&#39;s outfit.</p>

<p class="indent">The great difficulty with young actors is a tendency
to overdress and to attempt to hide bad tailoring
with a flashy design and a freak cut of the coat. Since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
clothes are an actor&#39;s stock in trade, he should patronize
only the best, if the most expensive tailors, and stick
to conservative lines unless the part requires eccentric
dressing. Jewelry should be avoided, unless called
for in the character; cuff links and a watch chain are
all that should be worn, with the exception of dress
studs with the dinner or dress coat.</p>

<p class="indent">Girls will need a simple afternoon suit and an outer
coat to match. They must have two summer frocks,
a sailor blouse with a dark skirt, neglig&eacute;e, and an
evening gown and wraps. Hats to match are necessary,
of course, as are dancing slippers and white duck
shoes.</p>

<p class="indent">The evening gown is perhaps the most important
part of the young actress&#39;s wardrobe, since she is more
apt to be called in for ball and dinner scenes than
any other. Simplicity should be the keynote of such
gowns. Simple French models are very attractive, but
few women can wear them well, since most American
girls are too broad in the shoulders for the Parisian
styles.</p>

<p class="indent">Clothes for character parts must be assembled on
the moment according to the demands of the director
and the imagination of the actor or actress. Realism
is the great essential of character dressing. To wear
the rags of a vaudeville tramp in the movies would
turn the picture into a slapstick comedy. A real
tramp&#39;s clothes are a mighty different matter.</p>

<p class="indent">The greatest difficulty which a casting director experiences
is that of finding people to play the part of
society folk. These parts require an understanding
of drawing-room manners and ballroom etiquette, and
the ability to wear smart clothes. If the clothes are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
not up to the moment they will be obsolete when the
picture reaches the country at large, and the audiences
will think that because the styles are out of date the
picture is out of date also. Also if any extreme
styles are worn they are sure to be out of date when
the picture is shown. In the same way, the slightest
error in etiquette is sure to be noted and commented
upon. It is more of a trick than one might think
to know, at a moment&#39;s notice, how to act as best man
at a fashionable wedding, or how to serve a ten-course
dinner according to the latest vogue.</p>

<p class="indent">The best way is to dress conservatively and to act
as any well bred person might be expected to. A
man who fails to take off his hat upon entering a
fashionable house would be laughed at. A man who
took it off with a grand flourish would be hooted out.
Recently a director read in a certain short story that
the Newport set had instituted the custom of supplying
a single green glove for each dinner guest to wear
while the olives were served. This was merely a bit
of satire on the part of the story writer&mdash;but the
director took it seriously, and instituted the fad in a
dinner scene with dire results when the picture was
shown to the newspaper critics.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
MOVIE MANNERS</h2>

<p class="indent">This chapter does not deal so much with how to
act in a picture as how to act in a studio.</p>

<p class="indent">Motion picture people live, more or less, in a world
of their own. It is a world which may seem a bit topsy
turvy to the outsider, with its own peculiar customs,
and a greater freedom from restraint than is customary
in the conventional world outside. Examined
a bit closer, these outlandish ideas appear to be the
very same ones which are always associated with
artists&mdash;a bohemian spirit which is the same whether
in Hollywood or the Latin Quarter of Paris.</p>

<p class="indent">If the newcomer to the studio wishes to establish
himself as a bona fide member of the movie world
he must always remember that no matter how cynical
they may seem, no matter how pessimistically they
may talk, these people, in the bottom of their hearts,
consider a photoplay a form of art and themselves as
artists. The actor or director or author who does
really good work, who has something new to offer, or
who at least is sincere in his desire to do something
big and fine in the motion pictures, will always be
tolerated no matter how bizarre his character in other
respects. In short, people are ranked according to
their artistic understanding rather than according to
their ancestry, their bank account or their morals.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
Most of the leaders of the motion picture world have
risen from poverty and obscurity, a fact which accounts
for the democracy which prevails in the studio.</p>

<p class="indent">There are a few rules which beginners would do
well to follow. Here they are:</p>

<p class="indent">Be modest. Because you don&#39;t understand why
something is done, don&#39;t believe it is all nonsense.
And remember that you have ever so much to learn
about the business.</p>

<p class="indent">Don&#39;t criticize.</p>

<p class="indent">Try your best to please everyone, particularly the
director, whose shoulders are carrying the responsibility
for the whole production and whose manner may
be a bit gruff&mdash;as it usually is when a man is laboring
under a heavy load.</p>

<p class="indent">Don&#39;t be ashamed of being in the movies. If you
think movies are a low-brow form of making a living
your associates will surely become aware of your
state of mind and you will be quietly frozen out.</p>

<p class="indent">In the old days of the movies social status in the
studio was determined by a curious system, based
upon the pay envelope. Actors&mdash;for the movie world
is composed for the greater part of actors&mdash;are classed
as stars, the &quot;leads,&quot; the &quot;parts,&quot; the &quot;bits,&quot; the
&quot;extras&quot; and &quot;mobs.&quot; The star is, of course, the
highly paid actor or actress who is the feature of the
production; the &quot;lead&quot; is the leading man or woman
who plays opposite the star; the &quot;parts&quot; include all
those characters which appear on the program&mdash;the
minor characters of the play; the &quot;bits&quot; are those who
are called on to perform a bit of individual action, such
as the butler who opens the door, or the chauffeur
who drives the car, but who have no real part in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
play; the extras are simply members of the crowd, as
the ballroom throng, while a mob is just a mass of
people, like an army or the audience at a football
game.</p>

<p class="indent">The large producing companies frequently give elaborate
dinners, seating three or four hundred people,
and under this ridiculous old system the star sat at
the head of the table, with the &quot;leads&quot; near at hand.
Then came the &quot;parts,&quot; then the &quot;bits,&quot; and finally,
away down at the foot of the table, were the &quot;extras.&quot;
In the same way directors, assistant directors, studio
managers, and so forth, were graded down according
to how much money they drew from the cashier every
week.</p>

<p class="indent">To-day all this snobbery has passed away. The
movie world has its smart set and its slums, as in any
other world, but the criterion is artistic worth, not
money. We know of one rather unpleasant personality
who has risen to stardom, but is completely ignored
by the lesser lights of the profession despite this star&#39;s
attempts to break into &quot;film society.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
READING YOUR PART</h2>

<p class="indent">On the legitimate stage actors and actresses are
called on to read their parts before beginning rehearsals.
In the movies the part is read to them.
Before the company begins to make even the first
scene in a photoplay the scenario writer and director
call a meeting and rehearse the company, reading
the scenario and explaining the meaning of each scene.
If the author and director are wise the story is then
carefully rehearsed clear through, scene by scene,
before anything is photographed. In this way the
actors learn the sequence of their scenes and the
relation of their parts to other parts and to the whole.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">
<img class="border" src="images/gs02.jpg" width="700" height="422" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rehearsing the Company</span></p>
<p>Movie authors should rehearse their own stories, at least, according to John Emerson and
Anita Loos. Here these authors, on the left, are rehearsing their scenarios for &quot;Wife Insurance&quot;
while the director, Victor Fleming (with the cap) takes notes. Rehearsals are
arranged before the scenery is built, and the above tableau is supposed to take place in a
restaurant.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It is up to you to make the best of your part.
Secure a copy of the scenario, or at least of your scenes,
as soon as possible. Then go over the story as many
times as possible, trying to grasp the relationship of
your own character to that of the other characters in
the story. Work out your own conception of the part.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps at first the director will never give you a
chance to do a piece of original acting. He will work
out every bit of action for you. Eventually, however,
your opportunity will come to &quot;create a part,&quot; and you
must be ready for it.</p>

<p class="indent">All the action of a motion picture story is contained
in the numbered scenes of the scenario. Your bit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
acting will be in one or more of these scenes. Here
is a sample bit of one of our own scenarios, based
on the stage play &quot;Mama&#39;s Affair,&quot; which we recently
wrote for Constance Talmadge. These are the last
few scenes of the photoplay:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indentedmargin">Eve watches her mother go out, then turns to
the doctor, goes to him, gives him her hand, and
says very quietly:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;<span class="smcap">Good-by, Doctor.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The doctor looks at her, astonished, and says,
&quot;What!&quot; Eve looks up at him sternly and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;<span class="smcap">Good-by; I Can Hardly Hope to See You
Again.</span></p>

<p class="indentedmargin">She then starts out the door. The doctor hurries
after her, stops her, and says, &quot;What do you
mean?&quot; Eve turns to look at him, and then says
very calmly:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;<span class="smcap">I Shall Be Leaving To-Morrow.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The doctor, taken aback, steps back a couple of
steps, looks at her in astonishment, and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;<span class="smcap">I Just Told You That I&#39;d Marry You!</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Eve looks at him commiseratingly, smiles a cynical
smile, and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;<span class="smcap">You Just Told Me You Would Take Me in
because You See No Way to Prevent My Becoming
A Chronic Neurasthenic.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The doctor looks at her, flabbergasted at the
plain way in which she is putting things. She
then goes on and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;<span class="smcap">You Don&#39;t Want Me, But You&#39;ll Take Me
in as You&#39;d Take a Patient into a Hospital.</span>&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indentedmargin">The doctor looks at her, tries to speak, stammers,
stops, not knowing what to say. Eve then takes
a step toward him, smiles commiseratingly, and
says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;<span class="smcap">You Don&#39;t Have to Do That. I Have
Learned How to Handle Mama. You
Don&#39;t Have to Worry about My Health.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The doctor looks at her, surprised at this new
Eve, who is in no need of him at all in his professional
capacity. Eve looks at him, throws
out her arms with gestures of complete victory
over all her worries, and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;<span class="smcap">I am Going Back to New York, And I am
Going to Live.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Eve then turns, starts, goes toward the door
and starts to go out. The doctor looks at her,
struggles with himself, worries over the fact
that he is losing her, goes toward her, and says:
&quot;Eve!&quot; She turns, looks at him, and says:
&quot;Yes?&quot; He looks at her helplessly, trying to
find words to express himself, and then says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;<span class="smcap">I Can&#39;t Let You Go Like This.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Eve looks at him calmly, and asks why. The
doctor looks around helplessly, stalls a moment,
and then says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;<span class="smcap">Because I Love You.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Eve looks at him a moment, and then, dropping
all her pose, simply overcome with intense relief,
she says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;<span class="smcap">Well, That&#39;s What I&#39;ve Been Trying to
Get at.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The doctor rushes over to her, grabs her, takes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
her in his arms, looks into her face, and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;<span class="smcap">You Bold-faced, Shameless Little Darling.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Then gives her a good kiss, and we <span class="smcap">FADE OUT</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">You will observe that in the scenario there are many
lines written in for the actors to speak which never
appear on the screen (only those in capitals are shown
on the screen). This is to give the cast a chance to
say the things they would say in real life under the
same circumstances, and so to make the scene entirely
natural. The actor speaks all the lines in small type
and also those in the capital letters, following the
abbreviation &quot;SP,&quot; which stands for &quot;Spoken Title.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Contrary to common belief, the actors really speak
the words of their lines. There was a day when the
hero, kissing the heroine in the final close-up, might
say something like &quot;Let&#39;s go out and get a cheese
sandwich, now that this is over.&quot; But just about this
time large numbers of lip-readers began to write in to
the producers, kicking against this sort of thing. It
seems that constant attendance at the movies develops
a curious power of following a speech by watching
the character&#39;s lips. And from that day the slapstick
comedians who used to swear so beautifully before
the camera and the heroines of the serial thrillers who
used to talk about the weather in their big scenes
began to speak their proper lines.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
INSIDE THE BRAIN OF A MOVIE STAR</h2>

<p class="indent">&quot;But they have no brains!&quot; someone is sure to say.</p>

<p class="indent">That sort of thing is rather cheap cynicism. As a
matter of fact, they have plenty of brains, but of
their own peculiar sort. A movie actor, like any other
type of artist, is an emotional, temperamental creature;
but the problem which worries him the most is
one of intellect rather than emotion; in short, just
how to control the reactions inside that discredited
gray matter of his.</p>

<p class="indent">Every movie actor&mdash;and you, too, if you enter this
field&mdash;is at one time or another confronted with the
perplexing problem of just how much thought he
should allow to go into his work; that is, whether his
acting should be emotional or intellectual. The question
resolves itself into this:</p>

<p class="indent">Does an actor feel?</p>

<p class="indent">Should he feel?</p>

<p class="indent">There are two schools of thought on this seemingly
academic but in reality most important subject.</p>

<p class="indent">First are those who say that an actor must feel
the part he is playing. The greatest actors, they say,
have always been those who wore themselves out in
an hour&#39;s time, because they felt the emotions they
portrayed. They tell stories such as that of Mrs. Kendall,
who, having lost her own child, electrified an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
English audience by her portrayal of the bereaved
mother in &quot;East Lynne&quot; to such an extent that women
leaped to their feet in the pit, shouting, &quot;No more, no
more.&quot; They point to the fact that the great stars of
the screen and the stage alike are able to simulate the
three reactions which are quite beyond the control of
the will&mdash;pallor, blushing, and the sudden perspiration
which comes with great terror or pain. This, they
say, is proof positive that these actors are feeling
every emotion as they enact it.</p>

<p class="indent">The second group declares that all this is nonsense
and that if an actor really felt his part he would lose
control of himself, and perhaps actually murder some
other actor in a fight scene. Acting, they say, is an
art wherein the artist, by the use of his intellect, is
able to simulate that which he does not feel&mdash;using
his face merely as the painter uses his canvas. The
moment an actor begins to enter into his part, his
acting is either overdone or underdone and the scene
is ruined. The whole trick of it, they add, is to keep
perfectly cool and know exactly what you are doing,
no matter how spectacular the scene.</p>

<p class="indent">Still a third school declares that both these views
are wrong, and that acting is neither a matter of
thought nor of emotion, but is purely imitative. An
actor observes his own emotions as he experiences
them in each crisis of his real life, they say, and remembers
them so well that he is afterward able to
reproduce them before the camera.</p>

<p class="indent">The truth of it seems to be that all of them are
partly right and partly wrong. The great stars of the
movies to-day, when one is able to draw them out on
the subject, say that when they are acting they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
thinking not about one thing but about several things.
The brain is divided into different strata, and while
one section is thinking about the part, another section
is entering into it, while still a third stratum is busying
itself with idle speculation about the cameraman
and the director.</p>

<p class="indent">There are two important secrets, connected with the
psychology of screen acting, which every beginner
should know, even if he never makes use of them.
The first is that of Preparation; the second, that of
Auto-Suggestion.</p>

<p class="indent">A movie actor or actress is in a more difficult position,
so far as the artistry of his work is concerned,
than the players of the spoken drama. In the movies
the scenes are nearly always taken out of sequence,
the first last, the last first, and so forth. For that
reason the motion picture stars have great difficulty
in working themselves up to the proper &quot;pitch&quot; to play
a scene, inasmuch as they have not been through the
action which leads up to it.</p>

<p class="indent">The movie directors know this, and in most studios
try to help them up to this &quot;pitch&quot; by employing small
orchestras to play during the important scenes. In
nearly every large studio where more than one company
is working there are to be heard the faint strains
of Sonata Pathetique, where some melancholy scene
is being taken, or livelier music for a bit of comedy
in another set. Also the directors are always behind
the camera to guide their actors with spoken directions
as the scene is made. This orchestra business
has always seemed to us pure buncombe, but if the
director or actor gets any fun out of it, it doesn&#39;t do
any particular harm.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
The wise movie actors of to-day are borrowing
these two tricks of Preparation and Auto-Suggestion
from their brethren of the stage.</p>

<p class="indent">Preparation consists merely of spending a little
time before the scene is begun in going over the part,
in thinking about it, and in trying really to feel all the
emotions of the character in question. This seems a
simple matter; but it makes the difference between
real acting and routine work. Once an actor has carefully
worked out the part for himself he can easily
conform to the director&#39;s ideas; and once he has let
himself feel his part he need waste no emotion upon
it when on the &quot;set,&quot; for his mimetic powers will
reproduce his feelings of an hour before.</p>

<p class="indent">Auto-suggestion consists in working oneself up to
the part before going before the camera by various
expedients. For example, one actor, before playing a
part calling for extreme anger, spends some ten minutes
in clenching his fists, swearing at the handiest
fence post, setting his jaw&mdash;and so making himself
really angry. It is not hard to reproduce emotion by
these tricks of auto-suggestion. Try thinking of something
sad&mdash;draw your face down&mdash;and before long
you will be in a very glum mood. That is the way
such stars as Norma Talmadge and Mary Pickford
produce tears on short notice. Most people think
they are tricks of make-up, such as drops of glycerine;
as a matter of fact, it is a matter of puckering the
face and a few gloomy thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">All this sort of thing sounds very intricate and
unnecessary. And yet it is the really practical side
of screen acting. The psychology of each actor is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
different and his manner of preparing for a scene
and of enacting it will be different. The important
thing is that he be aware that there is such a thing
as psychology, and that if he will only understand it
as applied to himself he can improve his work as a
film player.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
SALARIES IN THE MOVIES</h2>

<p class="indent">So much propaganda and press-agentry has been at
work during the last few years that no one knows
what to believe of the movies. There appears to be
a sort of attenuated smoke cloud thrown up about
all connected with the artistic, and, more particularly,
the financial side of the movies. And naturally the
first question to be asked by one who is considering
entering this field as a vocation is &quot;What do they pay?
Is it all true? Is there money in the movies?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The leading stars of the screen get anywhere from
one thousand to ten thousand dollars a week. There
are only two or three stars, however, who get as high
as ten thousand. The majority range between one
and three thousand.</p>

<p class="indent">A few stars are paid a percentage of the profits
of the picture. One or two others are paid a lump
sum for a picture, rather than a weekly salary, and
in one case this lump sum comes to eighty thousand
dollars.</p>

<p class="indent">A good leading man or leading woman gets four
or five hundred dollars a week&mdash;some much more.
First rate character people, or &quot;heavies,&quot; get from
three to five hundred a week, or, if called on to play
by the day, get anywhere from fifty to a hundred
dollars.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
The smaller parts bring salaries ranging from fifty
to two hundred dollars. &quot;Bits,&quot; such as the butler
who opens the door, which involve a small bit of individual
acting, although really merely atmospheric
work, bring ten dollars a day or thereabouts. Extras
for the crowd scenes get about five dollars a day.</p>

<p class="indent">The salaries of directors range all the way from
ten thousand dollars a week, which is the emolument
of one great artist, down to the hundred and fifty a
week of the fly-by-night concerns. The average
director in a large company gets anywhere from five
hundred to a thousand dollars a week, especially as at
present there is a great shortage of good directors.</p>

<p class="indent">Scenario writers are paid according to the type of
work they do. If they write original stories they may
get from one thousand to twenty thousand dollars for
them. Of course, the published works of notable
authors or the stage hits of famous playwrights bring
more.</p>

<p class="indent">Writers doing the adaptations or &quot;continuities&quot; of
the stories of others are more often paid by the week.
The big scenario writers get salaries ranging up to
hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, for this is
fast becoming the most important work of the entire
industry. The lesser lights seldom receive less than
twenty thousand dollars a year.</p>

<p class="indent">Cameramen get from one hundred to three hundred
dollars a week. Art directors receive several hundred
dollars a week, but few companies have as yet realized
the necessity of employing specialists in scenic art.</p>

<p class="indent">A good five-reel feature picture to-day costs about
sixty thousand dollars to produce. If a famous star
is employed, the cost of the picture goes to a hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
thousand dollars, or even a hundred and fifty. &quot;&#39;Way
Down East,&quot; Griffith&#39;s latest production, cost just
under a million dollars to produce.</p>

<p class="indent">The profits of the picture come out of its run, which
may last seven or eight years, and even longer in
Europe. A one hundred thousand dollar picture may
eventually make half a million dollars for it&#39;s backers,
but, of course, they have a long wait for their money.
On the other hand, the risk is stupendous, for the
picture may be a flat failure.</p>

<p class="indent">One cheering fact, attested by all motion picture
magnates, is that, whatever may be the case in other
industries, salaries are not going to drop in the movies.
On the contrary, the movies are growing bigger and
bigger and the demand is greater than ever before.
There is money in the movies now, and there will be
even more in the next few years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
SCENARIOS</h2>

<p class="indent">On the legitimate stage nearly every actor at one
time or another writes a play. In the same way, in
the movies nearly every actor tries his hand at scenario
writing. In fact, many of the most successful
playwrights and photodramatists have had stage or
screen experience as actors.</p>

<p class="indent">For this reason, although this series is designed
more for those who wish to act than for those who
wish to write&mdash;and although we have already one book
on &quot;How to Write Photoplays&quot;&mdash;nevertheless, a chapter
on scenario writing is not out of place.</p>

<p class="indent">There is a fine career for any writer in scenario
writing if the writer will only take the trouble to study
it seriously. There is technique in writing plots and
still more technique in adapting those plots to the
screen, by writing them into scenario form. Studio
experience is of vast benefit to anyone who wishes to
write movie stories; and that is where the actor has
the advantage over the outsider who tries to write
scenarios with no practical knowledge of how movies
are really made.</p>

<p class="indent">First write your plot into a five hundred or thousand
word synopsis, just as you would write it for a magazine.
Make it brief and clear. Be sure it is based
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
upon action, mental or physical, and try to give real
character to your plot people.</p>

<p class="indent">In choosing your story be sure it has the dramatic
quality. It must not be rambling; and it must have an
element of conflict between opposing factors&mdash;a man
and a woman, a woman and her Destiny, or simply
Good and Evil&mdash;which leads up to a crisis in which
the matter is fought out and finally settled. Stories
which have not these qualities are suitable for novels,
perhaps, but not for plays.</p>

<p class="indent">It is, as a general rule, inadvisable to try historical
stories or stories which require elaborate scenes.
Battle stories and stories of the Jules Verne or H. G.
Wells type are also difficult to place. The great demand
to-day is for sane, wholesome stories of modern
American life, wherein character is the paramount
interest rather than eccentricities of the plot or camera.</p>

<p class="indent">Send your story in synopsis form to the scenario
editor of the studio which employs the star for whom
you think the story is best suited. Send with it a
stamped and self-addressed envelope for the return
of your script, if it is not suitable for their use.
Keep on sending it; don&#39;t be discouraged by rejection
slips. You may write dozens of stories and then sell
the very first one you wrote.</p>

<p class="indent">If the studio buys your story it is well to ask for
an opportunity to help write the &quot;continuity,&quot; or
scenario form. This is a highly technical but very well
paid task, and one which every screen author should
learn. The chance to enter the studio and help work
out the scenario of your own story is worth trying for.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Testing Make-Up and Expression.</p>
<p>Every make-up must conform to the part. Here the authors, John Emerson and Anita
Loos, are helping their director, Victor Fleming, to make a test of Basil Sydney and May
Collins, who played the leading roles in &quot;Wife Insurance.&quot; The tests are usually taken
in some corner of the studio under the best possible lighting conditions.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Scenarios to-day are more in demand than ever before;
but producers are still chary of taking chances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
on untried amateurs. The amateur author&#39;s greatest
success is when he sells his first story. The road is
comparatively easy after that.</p>

<p class="indent">Original plots for five-reel pictures sell from $1,000
to $20,000, depending upon the reputation of the author
and the standing of the company which buys them.
Of course, some of the smaller companies pay less
than this, and two and three reel features sell for less.</p>

<p class="indent">Published stories and novels, and plays which have
had a run, bring enormous prices. Griffith recently
paid $150,000 for the film rights on a play. Fifty and
seventy thousand dollars are frequently paid for similar
plot material, but that is because of the advertising
value in the names of the plays or books, or the
reputation of the writers, which assures the producers
that the story is almost sure to make a good photoplay.</p>

<p class="indent">The highest paid workers in the movies to-day are
the continuity writers, who put the stories into scenario
form and write the &quot;titles&quot; or written inserts.
The income of some of these writers runs into hundreds
of thousands of dollars a year. It is extraordinarily
interesting work and well worth while learning;
but unfortunately the technical training for this
sort of thing takes as much time as the training necessary
to enter any other profession.</p>

<p class="indent">Scenario writing does not require great genius. It
does require a dramatic insight and certain amount
of training. It is the latter factor that most amateurs
overlook. If you are to write scenarios, you must take
your work as seriously as you would if you were trying
to write music or paint pictures.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
HOW OTHERS HAVE DONE IT</h2>

<p class="indent">The histories of the movie celebrities are as picturesque
as the story of their industry. Nearly all
of them have risen from the ranks. Few of them, in
the days when the motion picture was classed as a
freak novelty, expected the present amazing expansion
of the industry; still fewer had any conception of their
own latent talents in photodramatic art.</p>

<p class="indent">But characteristics which they all had in common
were determination to succeed in their profession, a
modest faith in its future, and a desire to learn the
business from the ground up.</p>

<p class="indent">It is a curious fact that many of the directors of
to-day were once automobile mechanics. This is not
because automobile mechanics are as a class better
fitted for such work, but because, in the old days of
1907 and 1908 and 1909, when everything started, they
had a singular opportunity to apprentice themselves
to the profession.</p>

<p class="indent">In those days companies worked almost entirely
out of doors, and the cameraman transported his paraphernalia
in an automobile. The driver of the automobile
would usually assist the cameraman in &quot;setting
up&quot;; a friendship would spring up between them;
presently the driver would be assistant cameraman,
then chief cameraman, and finally director. Of course,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
directors have been recruited from every profession
and every class&mdash;actors, authors, professors, newspaper
men, scene carpenters, artists&mdash;for the dramatic
gift is not confined to any class. What a man&#39;s profession
was before he entered the movies has nothing
to do with his career thereafter; he has to learn everything
all over again, and a very good actor, with years
of studio experience, may make a very poor director,
whereas an unsuccessful tinsmith might suddenly rise
to the top by virtue of an innate gift for this type of
work.</p>

<p class="indent">The scenario writers of to-day have also grown up
with the business. Some were newspaper men who
broke into the game as press-agents; some were actors;
others were directors. Recently a large number of
professional playwrights, novelists and authors with
magazine experience have entered the movies to learn
scenario writing, but this is a new development.</p>

<p class="indent">The writers of this series have been asked to tell
how they themselves broke into the scenario offices.
Unlike the others, our own story has nothing picturesque
about it. Miss Loos was born and bred in
a California town; she was the daughter of a newspaper
proprietor and inherited that fatal desire to
write. At the age of fourteen she sent her first scenario
to Griffith; for a miracle, it was accepted&mdash;but,
of course, it was easy to sell stories in those days,
when scenario writing was almost unheard of outside
of California. Soon after this she paid a personal
visit to the Griffith studios and became the youngest
scenario editor in the world, turning out a new story
about every six weeks. Some six years ago Mr. Emerson
left his post as producer for Frohman on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
legitimate stage and went to Hollywood to keep an eye
on the filming of one of his own plays which was being
adapted from the &quot;speakies.&quot; He decided to make the
movies a permanent profession, and with this in mind
worked as an actor about the Griffith studios to learn
the rudiments of the game. Some months after this
he was allowed to direct his first picture; and at this
time he met Miss Loos, who was to write the scenario.
After that they collaborated in the Doug&#39; Fairbanks&#39;
pictures&mdash;and that&#39;s that.</p>

<p class="indent">Most of the present-day movie actors and actresses
gained their experience as extras, although a few have
first made their success on the legitimate stage and
then stepped directly into film stardom. Doug&#39; Fairbanks
was one of the latter, and so was Mary Pickford.
Charley Chaplin and Wallace Reid, on the
other hand, have done little of note outside of the
movies.</p>

<p class="indent">Both Norma Talmadge and Constance Talmadge
rose from the ranks. They took small parts in the
old Vitagraph pictures; but their extraordinary beauty
and talent was immediately recognized by the directors,
and they were permitted to try bits, then parts, and
finally leads. Norma Talmadge went in for the more
emotional r&ocirc;les, while Constance developed her ability
as a comedienne. Within six years they have attained
to position of leadership in their respective fields.</p>

<p class="indent">D. W. Griffith himself was once an extra. He was
a good extra, too, according to some of his former
employers who now work under him in his great
studios at Mamaroneck, Conn. But he had all manner
of queer ideas as to how pictures should be acted, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
directed and photographed. For example, he thought
that more effective scenes might be made, at times, by
photographing actors &quot;close up,&quot; cutting off their legs
and arms with the frame of the picture and showing
only their faces many times enlarged; also he had a
theory that one might heighten the dramatic suspense
by &quot;cutting back&quot; from one scene to another, instead
of following one line of action in a monotonous sequence
through an entire photoplay. The directors and
actors and cameramen of those days, who would no
sooner have thought of taking a character&#39;s picture
from the bust up than of taking the picture upside
down, were nevertheless interested in this eccentric
chap, and even asked his advice from time to time.
Finally, the eccentric extra got his chance as a director
to try out a few of these radical theories. His &quot;The
Birth of a Nation&quot; changed the entire technique of the
movies.</p>

<p class="indent">Many noted directors received their training in
directing plays for the legitimate stage, as, for example,
Hugh Ford. Others, like Marshall Neilan, or
Allan Dwan, came in from outside professions. Victor
Fleming, formerly director for Douglas Fairbanks
and Constance Talmadge, was one of the latter.
His first success, many years ago, was as an
automobile designer, but his interest always lay
with the theater; he resigned his post with the automobile
company at about the age when most young
men are seeking their first jobs, and decided to learn
the business of making movies. The same creative
faculty which made his automobile designs distinctive
in the old days manifested itself in his pictures last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
year, &quot;The Mollycoddle&quot; and &quot;When the Clouds Roll
By.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There are a million ways to break into the movies.
No one can imitate the career of another. Don&#39;t read
other people&#39;s biographies; go out and make one for
yourself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
AMATEUR MOVIE MAKING</h2>

<p class="indent">Amateur theatrical clubs, theater guilds, and the
like, have done much to make the modern drama the
great art that it is. But because of the overwhelming
expense heretofore attached to the making of movies
there have been no attempts at any similar activities
in the films. The movies have never had the advantage
of the experiments of amateur societies.</p>

<p class="indent">To-day, however, the making of movies by amateurs
is a distinct possibility. The possibilities of making
a motion picture at comparatively little expense were
first drawn to public attention five years ago when
two young men, both of whom have become well-known
directors, made a saleable photoplay in their
own back yard. These boys had many theories about
what a movie should and should not be, but they
could never find a company willing to give their
theories a trial. Finally they hit upon the original
expedient of buying their own camera and making a
picture in which nearly all the actors were children
and which therefore cost very little money. Nearly
all the scenes were exteriors, so that practically no
scenery was required. The picture was most original
and in spite of their technical shortcomings, they found
a fairly profitable sale.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
If you desire to write, direct or act in the pictures,
you can have no better experience than trying to make
a picture of your own, even if at first you are not very
successful.</p>

<p class="indent">The great initial expense for this sort of thing is,
of course, the outlay required to buy a camera. In
most towns of any size there are now professional
movie cameramen who work for the news reel companies
and who may be hired for a comparatively
small sum. If, however, you desire to make your
photoplay an entirely amateur affair, you can buy a
usable second-hand camera for outdoor work for as
low as a hundred dollars.</p>

<p class="indent">Some one of your associates must make it his business
to learn to run this camera with sufficient skill
to insure that your film will not be wasted.</p>

<p class="indent">The next important outlay is that of the film itself.
Film costs about eleven or twelve cents a foot when
developed and printed. Therefore, the cost of production
depends largely upon the length of your picture.
For a first attempt we should advise you to
keep your photoplay within 2,000 feet, or two reels.</p>

<p class="indent">Start by writing a simple story into a scenario with
as many exterior scenes as possible. The necessary interiors,
such as rooms or hallways, may be built by
your own amateurs, outdoors, as they are often built
in California, so that no lights will be necessary. You
can paint your own subtitle cards&mdash;the written inserts&mdash;and
film them yourself.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">
<img class="border" src="images/gs07.jpg" width="700" height="415" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Making a &quot;Close-Up&quot;</span></p>
<p>Sun reflectors, consisting of silvered canvas screens, are used to lighten the shadows, which
are apt to make the cheeks seem hollow. The actors are Basil Sydney and May Collins.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It is not necessary to make the scenes in their natural
sequence. After the picture is finished and developed,
however, someone must assemble and cut it.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
This means that you must rent the use of the projection
machine at your local theater for a few mornings,
and get the local operator to help you splice and
cement the film together in its correct order of long
shots and close-ups. There is no rule for this work
except that of practical values on the screen. Just
run your bits of film through the projection machine
and stick them together the way they look best. It
is a matter of artistic perception rather than any set
rule.</p>

<p class="indent">If your scenario calls for an outdoor picture&mdash;for
example, a cowboy story&mdash;which does not require costumes,
you should be able to make it for a thousand
dollars, provided your amateur actors, and amateur
cameramen, and amateur authors are working for
nothing. There are mighty few amateur theatricals
of any pretention whatsoever which do not cost as
much as this, and you should be able to take in a good
profit if your picture is exploited in your local
theaters.</p>

<p class="indent">As a matter of fact, pictures have not always been
produced on the scale that they are to-day. Ten years
ago feature pictures cost from $5,000 to $7,000 to
make, and in those days film and cameras were much
more expensive. The producers simply made outdoor
pictures which required no lights or scenery, and saved
on the salaries of actors and directors, which have
multiplied twenty times since then. To-day the average
feature picture costs from $50,000 to $150,000 to produce.
Griffith&#39;s &quot;&#39;Way Down East&quot; cost nearly a
million to produce. That is because the salaries of
actors, directors and authors have risen so enormously.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
But there is no reason why an amateur company in
which the cost of salaries is completely eliminated cannot
make their own picture at a minimum expense. If
you want to break into the movies, here is a way to do
it, right in your own home town.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span></p>

<h2>INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO PART II</h2>

<p class="indent">Whether you desire to break into the movies as
writer, actor or director, your most important consideration
will be the scenario. In the scenario you will
find all the elements of the photoplay; everything is
built upon that as a foundation. The actor or director
who sincerely desires to do good work studies his
script assiduously. The ambitious writer analyzes not
only his own photoplays, but those of other people.</p>

<p class="indent">It is exceedingly difficult to talk technique to anyone
who has never read a scenario. For this reason we
have incorporated a &quot;continuity&quot; in this book. It is
the dramatic form of a screen story which we have
made as a special production. The titles, which are
the written inserts to be flashed on the screen, are in
capital letters. The inserts refer to such articles as
letters, telegrams, pictures, and the like, which may be
shown in close-up. The &quot;iris&quot; is the broadening or
narrowing of the frame of the picture to open or close
a scene, or to emphasize some particular object which
is &quot;irised&quot; upon. The &quot;fade&quot; effects are used very
much as the curtain of the legitimate stage is used to
open and close scenes. The abbreviation &quot;Sp&quot; means
&quot;Speech,&quot; indicating that the title which follows is to
be spoken by the actor. Some of the quoted lines&mdash;the
ones not set off in capitals&mdash;are not shown on the
screen, but are merely given as a guide for the players.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
Most of the directions concerning the scenes are also
given in capital letters. &quot;EXTERIOR,&quot; or the abbreviated
&quot;EXT.,&quot; for example, refers to a scene outdoors,
while &quot;INTERIOR&quot; or &quot;INT.,&quot; is an indoor
scene. The terms &quot;LONG SHOT&quot; and &quot;CLOSE-UP&quot;
refer to the distance at which the camera is placed
from the scene.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Red Hot Romance&quot; is played as a romantic melodrama,
but is intended as a satire upon this very type
of story, with its incredibly heroic hero, its American
girl, its marines-to-the-rescue and all the rest of it.
Basil Sydney and May Collins played the parts of
Roland and Rosalie, and Victor Fleming was the
director.</p>

<h2>RED HOT ROMANCE</h2>

<p>T: IT&#39;S BAD ENOUGH FOR SOME TO BOSS
THE REST OF US WHILE THEY ARE
ALIVE, BUT THE LIMIT IS REACHED
WHEN THEY WANT TO KEEP RIGHT ON
AFTER THEY HAVE CASHED IN.</p>

<p>T: FOR INSTANCE, THERE WAS OLD HARDER
N. STONE, THE VICE-PRESIDENT OF
THE BRITISH-AMERICAN INSURANCE CO.</p>

<p>1. LIBRARY, STONE HOME IN WASHINGTON.
(Fade in.) Harder N. Stone, an old skinflint,
is seated at his desk writing.</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;Stone&#39;s hand writing the following:</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">&quot;I, Harder N. Stone, of Washington, D. C.,
hereby direct that, should I die before my son,
Roland Stone, he is to receive from my estate
the sum of $50.00 per week and the use of my
residence in Washington, D. C, until his twenty-fifth
birthday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Stone sits back and regards what he has been
writing, smiles smugly, and then continues writing.</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;Stone&#39;s hand writing the following:</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">&quot;On his twenty-fifth birthday, provided he
has lived according to instructions herein set
down, my son, Roland Stone, is to receive his
inheritance at the hands of my chosen executor,
Lord Howe-Greene, of London, President of
the British-American Insurance Co.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Stone sits back and reads over what he has
written and is highly pleased. He then rings for
a servant and presently Briggs enters. He is a
little English butler, who has been in the family
for years. Stone turns to him and tells him that
he has just been making out his will. Briggs is
properly impressed and Stone says to him:</p>

<p>SP:  &quot;BRIGGS, I HAVE PROVIDED IN MY WILL
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
THAT IF I DIE BEFORE MY SON YOU ARE
TO STAY ON WITH HIM AS LONG AS YOU
LIVE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Briggs is highly pleased, thanks him, Stone
dismisses him, goes on writing. (Fade out.)</p>

<p>THE OLD BOY DID DIE, AS HE DESERVED
TO, AND LEFT HIS SON AND
HEIR, ROLAND STONE, WITH NOTHING
TO DO BUT LIVE ON $50.00 PER WEEK.</p>

<p>2. ROLAND&#39;S BEDROOM. (Fade in.) He is
lolling in bed in pajamas and dressing gown,
smoking a cigarette and opening a stack of bills
and reading them.</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;top bill&mdash;tailor&#39;s bill with a balance from the
month before and about $275.00 for this month
with a note in heavy letters &quot;PLEASE REMIT.&quot;
This one is turned over, and the second one is
from a club with a statement &quot;You have this day
been posted for $179.00 and your credit is hereby
suspended until same is paid.&quot; This bill is turned
over and the third bill is from a florist&#39;s for $950.00
worth of flowers sent to Miss Rosalie Bird and
has a note reading: &quot;Impossible for us to fill
any more orders until these bills are paid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland puts down the bills in disgust, not
looking further, as he knows they&#39;re all alike.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Briggs, the butler, now enters and takes up
the breakfast tray which is lying on the bed
opposite beside Roland. Roland looks up to him,
then looks at the bills, and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO PAY
THESE BILLS ON $50.00 A WEEK?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Briggs shrugs his shoulders as though he
had nothing to do with it, and suggests that
Roland&#39;s bills are too big. He then leaves. Roland
looks after him, disgusted, runs through a
few more bills, throws them on the floor and at
this juncture, Tom, Roland&#39;s valet, a big husky
negro with a child-like, innocent smile, enters the
room with letters, goes to Roland and hands him
the letters. Roland looks at them and sees they
are more bills, puts them down. Tom picks up
others from floor and gives them to Roland, much
to his disgust. He looks up to Tom and says:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span></p>

<p>SP: &quot;YOU&#39;RE A FINE &#39;SECRETARY&#39;! WHAT
DO I PAY YOU FOR?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom looks up at him, round-eyed and smiles
and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;YOU DON&#39;T.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">This is a poser for Roland for a moment, he
finally regains his composure and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WELL, I AM GOING TO WHEN I GET MY
INHERITANCE NEXT APRIL.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom nods his head quizzically as he has heard
this many times before. Roland then picks up the
bills, runs through them again and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THE QUESTION NOW IS&mdash;HOW ARE WE
GOING TO LIVE UNTIL APRIL?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He sighs, reaches over to a table which has a
little calendar on it, picks up the calendar, sees
that it is the 13th of January, and runs through
the pages very dubiously. He finally looks up
at Tom, shows him how many days they have to
live through on the calendar, and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I HAVEN&#39;T A NICKEL AND I CAN&#39;T
BORROW ANYTHING NOW. HOW ARE
WE GOING TO LIVE UNTIL APRIL?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom looks about very dubiously. Finally he
gets an idea, he looks from one object of furniture
to another, and his idea grows until he is
fairly beaming and he says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THEY&#39;S A MIGHTY LOT OF HOCKABLE
STUFF AROUND HEAH, BOSS!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He indicates the things around the room, and
Roland is delighted with the idea. He picks up
the bunch of bills, looks at the top one.</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;TAILOR&#39;S BILL.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland then looks around for something to pay
that with and his eye falls upon an antique vase.
He jumps out of bed, takes the vase and hands
it to Tom together with the tailor&#39;s bill, saying
that that will pay for that. Roland looks at the
next bill.</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;BILL FROM CLUB.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland then takes a couple of ornaments from
the mantel, gives them to Tom together with the
club bill saying that they will pay for that.
Roland then looks at the next bill.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span></p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;FLORIST&#39;S BILL.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland then takes a picture from the wall, leaving
a discolored place behind it, saying that will
pay for that. He then thinks a moment and picks
up a little antique clock and hands it to Tom,
saying:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;AND BUY HER SOME ORCHIDS WITH
THIS.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom grins, goes out loaded down with all the
junk. Roland looks after him, very pleased with
himself, and, probably thinking of his girl and
the orchids, smiles, and fade out.</p>

<p>T:  INDICATING THAT IT&#39;S TEA TIME.</p>

<p>3. EXTERIOR COLONEL BIRD&#39;S HOUSE.
(Fade in.)</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland comes down the street with a bunch
of orchids in his hand and goes up and rings
the bell.</p>

<p>T:  COLONEL BIRD, OF VIRGINIA, WHO HAS
BEEN HANGING AROUND WASHINGTON
FOR THIRTY-FIVE YEARS, WAITING FOR
A JOB WHICH WAS FIRST PROMISED
HIM BY PRESIDENT CLEVELAND.</p>

<p>4.  PARLOR, COLONEL BIRD&#39;S HOUSE. Colonel
Bird, seated at a desk, very busily reading
several large law books and making notes, trying
to &quot;kid&quot; himself into believing that he is busy.
A colored mammy presently shows in Roland,
who greets the Colonel very effusively. The
Colonel asks Roland to sit down, which he does.
The servant exits. The Colonel, not being very
greatly impressed with Roland, excuses himself
and goes on with his work, explaining that he
has some very important matters on hand.
Roland looks at him, smiles to himself, then looks
out expectantly toward the hall.</p>

<p>T: THE COLONEL&#39;S DAUGHTER, ROSALIE,
THE LADY OF THE ORCHIDS.</p>

<p>5. HALLWAY, COLONEL&#39;S HOUSE.  Rosalie
comes down the stairs and enters the parlor.</p>

<p>6. PARLOR, COLONEL&#39;S HOUSE. Rosalie
rushes over, greets Roland. The Colonel
rises until Roland and the girl are seated on a
sofa, when he sits and goes on with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
work. Roland gives Rosalie the orchids. Rosalie
thanks him, but says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;ROLAND, YOU SHOULDN&#39;T BUY ORCHIDS
EVERY DAY.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">She then points around to different vases in the
room, all of which are full of orchids. She holds
on to the orchids and gives Roland a little lecture
on economy, telling him he has no business to
spend his money so foolishly. And Roland says
he thought she liked orchids. She says she does
and he&#39;s a dear sweet boy to bring them, but he
sees she is not pleased and is correspondingly
depressed.</p>

<p>7.  EXTERIOR COLONEL&#39;S BIRD&#39;S HOUSE.
A low rakish roadster drives up and out of it
gets Jim Conwell. He has a small sized package
in his hand.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP&mdash;And he runs up and rings the bell.</p>

<p>T: JIM CONWELL IS ONE OF THAT BROTHERHOOD
OF DIPLOMATIC HANGERS-ON
WHO MAKE A SHADY LIVELIHOOD BY
DOING THE DIRTY WORK OF THE VARIOUS
WASHINGTON EMBASSIES.</p>

<p>8.  EXT. COLONEL BIRD&#39;S PORCH. The colored
mammy opens the door, lets in Conwell,
takes his hat and coat and shows him into the
parlor.</p>

<p>9. PARLOR COLONEL BIRD&#39;S HOUSE. The
colored mammy shows Conwell in, the old
Colonel jumps up from his desk, and greets him
very enthusiastically. His manner toward Conwell
is very different from his manner toward
Roland. Rosalie then greets Conwell very
sweetly but with reserve and Roland, giving him
a dirty look, greets him as coldly as possible.
The old Colonel now gives up his work to join
the group. Conwell holds out his little package
toward Rosalie and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;HERE&#39;S A LITTLE THING I PICKED UP
IN AN ANTIQUE SHOP. I THOUGHT
YOU&#39;D LIKE IT.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Rosalie puts down her orchids in Roland&#39;s
chair. She then takes the package, opens it up
and takes out Roland&#39;s clock. She lets out a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
cry of surprise and delight, then turns to Conwell
and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;IT&#39;S LOVELY! I&#39;VE ALWAYS WANTED
A CLOCK LIKE THAT.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland looks at this, open-mouthed and in
absolute astonishment, sits down in his chair,
smashing the orchids. Rosalie then shows the
clock to the old Colonel and the two of them
rave over it, forgetting the existence of Roland,
who finally comes to sufficiently to see that he&#39;s
sitting on something, gets up and picks up the
mashed orchids, looks at them disgustedly. The
clock is finally put in place on the mantel and
Rosalie comes back and joins Roland, who stands
looking ruefully at the flowers in his hand. He
dolefully shows them to her, and she, seeing he
is hurt, comforts him, telling him he&#39;s a dear
boy and she loves the orchids. She takes them
from him and tenderly straightens them out,
but Roland is still in the dumps. Conwell is
now throwing a lot of &quot;bull&quot; at the old Colonel,
saying:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I JUST SAID TO THE SECRETARY OF
STATE: &#39;YOU&#39;RE NOT LOOKING VERY
WELL, ELIHU, I WISH YOU&#39;D LET MY
OLD FRIEND, COLONEL BIRD, TAKE
SOME OF THE WORK OFF YOUR
HANDS.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He goes on spouting and the old Colonel fairly
eats it up. Finally, Roland, unhappy and jealous
and disgusted at Conwell, gets up and tells Rosalie
he has to go. Rosalie begs him to stay in
her sweetest manner, but Roland takes another
look at Conwell, says no, he&#39;s got to go, says
good-by to Rosalie and says good-by to the
Colonel and Conwell, and leaves.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">STREET EXT. COL. BIRD&#39;S HOUSE.&mdash;Roland
comes out and goes dolefully down the street.
(Fade out.)</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">HALLWAY ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE. Roland
enters, disheartened. Hangs up hat and coat
and stick and goes slowly into library.</p>

<p>10. LIBRARY ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE. (Fade in.)
Tom is fussing about the room. Roland enters<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
the room, terribly depressed and upset and starts
to tell Tom about the scene that just took
place. He goes on talking about Conwell and
finally says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THE OLD MAN STANDS FOR ALL OF
CONWELL&#39;S BUNK AND THINKS HE&#39;S
GREAT.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom is very sympathetic and tells Roland he
ought to settle the matter. Roland agrees with
him, pounds on the table, and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I THINK THE TIME HAS COME WHEN
I OUGHT TO TELL ROSALIE I LOVE
HER!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom agrees with him, says that&#39;s absolutely
right. Roland says he knows it&#39;s right&mdash;the only
thing to do is to come to an understanding right
away. He then goes over to the telephone and
calls a number, and while he is waiting for the
number, he goes on talking to Tom, telling him
just how he is going to settle things and Tom
encourages him.</p>

<p>11. HALLWAY COLONEL BIRD&#39;S HOUSE.
Rosalie comes down the hall to the telephone
and answers it.</p>

<p>12. LIBRARY ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE. Roland is
still talking to Tom, telling him how he&#39;s going
to lay down the law when he suddenly hears
Rosalie&#39;s voice over the &#39;phone. All his belligerency
oozes out. He smiles and stammers foolishly
and gulps and tries to get his courage up
as if he were going to lay matters right before
her and finally weakens and comes out with</p>

<p>SP: &quot;HOW ARE YOU?&quot;</p>

<p>13. HALLWAY COLONEL BIRD&#39;S HOUSE.
Rosalie, wondering what the devil he&#39;s asking
her that for when he just left her, frowns quizzically
and says that she&#39;s feeling all right.</p>

<p>14. LIBRARY ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE. Roland goes
on talking through the &#39;phone in a stammering
embarrassed sort of way, and Tom keeps telling
him to go on and tell her what he said he was
going to. Roland tries to motion to Tom and
he goes on stammering and stuttering.</p>

<p>15. HALLWAY COLONEL BIRD&#39;S HOUSE.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span></p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Rosalie still very quizzically listening to Roland.
She finally asks him what is the matter with him.</p>

<p>16. LIBRARY ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE. Roland stammering
into the &#39;phone. Finally Tom, utterly
disgusted, comes over to the &#39;phone and yells in
it:</p>

<p>SP:  &quot;HE&#39;S TRYING TO ASK YOU TO MARRY
HIM, MISS ROSALIE! WILL YOU?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland turns angrily to Tom, still holding the
receiver to his ear, and starts to berate Tom
soundly, when he suddenly hears something in
the telephone which stops him. He listens, overcome
with wonderment and finally says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;SAY THAT AGAIN!&quot;</p>

<p>17. HALLWAY  COLONEL  BIRD&#39;S  HOUSE.
Rosalie at the &#39;phone, laughing, says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;YES. OF COURSE I WILL!&quot;</p>

<p>18. LIBRARY ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE. Roland can
hardly believe his ears, makes her reiterate it,
then turns to Tom in great glee and says:</p>

<p>SP:  &quot;IT&#39;S ALL RIGHT. SHE SAYS YES.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He then turns back to the &#39;phone and asks
Rosalie if she really means it. While he is talking
to Rosalie, Tom goes over to a heavy couch,
pulls it out toward the hall. Roland still at the
&#39;phone talking, turns and asks Tom what he is
doing. Tom still pulling the couch says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;AH&#39;M GOING TO BUY YOU A ENGAGEMENT
RING.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland smiles and nods, and suddenly thinks of
the clock episode, stops Tom, tells him to wait
a minute, then turns toward the telephone and
says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE&mdash;A
RING OR A SOFA?&quot;</p>

<p>19. HALLWAY COLONEL BIRD&#39;S HOUSE.
Rosalie listening at the &#39;phone is utterly dumbfounded
at this odd request, she asks him to
repeat it, then finally still puzzled, says:</p>

<p>SP:  &quot;WHY, A RING, OF COURSE! YOU SILLY
BOY!&quot;</p>

<p>20.  LIBRARY ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE. Roland listening
at the &#39;phone, hears Rosalie wants the ring,
turns to Tom and tells him to go on and hock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
the sofa. He then turns to Rosalie, starts in to
talk to her ecstatically over the &#39;phone, smiling,
as we fade out.</p>

<p>T: THAT NIGHT AT THE HANGOUT OF THE
FRINGE OF THE DIPLOMATIC SET.</p>

<p>21. A WOP RESTAURANT. (Fade in.) This is
a typical $1.35 Table d&#39;Hote joint. Seated at
the various tables are many diplomatic hangers-on,
all of them crooked and all looking out for
the main chance. Among them is a Mexican, a
Frenchman, an Englishman, a German, a Russian,
an Italian, a Chinaman, a Jap, a Bulgarian, a
Hindoo and their women&mdash;perhaps three or four
Americans, but the atmosphere is generally foreign,
the waiters being Wops.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Seated at one table is Conwell alone. He is
eating spaghetti and looking very sourly about.</p>

<p>T: ENRICO DE CASTANET OF BUNKONIA.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Enrico is seated at a table talking to a very
attractive vamp type of a woman.</p>

<p>T: HIS LADY FRIEND (THE INTERNATIONAL
VAMP AND SPY), COUNTESS
PULLOFF DE PLOTZ.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The Countess is listening very intently to
Enrico. Enrico goes on talking very earnestly,
and finally says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;YOU SEE, WE MUST HAVE A MAN WHO
CAN BE BOUGHT BODY AND SOUL.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The Countess agrees with him, and perhaps
suggests somebody, whom Enrico says would
never do. The Countess starts thinking again,
and, as she does, her eyes wander over the room
and she sees Conwell, who has just gotten up,
paid his bill and given the waiter a very small
tip, at which the waiter shows his disgust. Conwell
then turns to leaves the restaurant, starts
down toward Enrico and the Countess. The
Countess sees him, has a sudden idea that he
would be fine for the job and points him out to
Enrico. At this moment, Conwell has stopped
to talk to someone at one of the tables, Enrico
looks him over from head to foot, asks the Countess
if she is sure he can be handled; she assures
him he can.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span></p>

<p>SP: &quot;HE WORKED FOR THE SHIPPING
BOARD.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Enrico agrees that he looks like a good bet,
and just at this moment Conwell comes past the
table, sees the Countess motion to him. He comes
over to the table, Enrico rises and the Countess
introduces him saying:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;SENOR DE CASTANET IS MINISTER OF
WAR OF BUNKONIA.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Conwell is mildly interested in this fact. Enrico
then asks Conwell to sit down, so he takes a seat,
and the Countess then begins to get very confidential.
She looks around to see that no one
is looking, then getting their three heads together,
she says in whispered tones:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WE ARE ENGINEERING A LITTLE REVOLUTION
DOWN IN BUNKONIA.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Conwell is a little more interested now. He
pricks up his ears a bit and casually glances
around to make sure no one is overhearing, then
looks to De Castanet for some information, and
De Castanet, with a quick glance around says
to Conwell:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THE AMERICAN CONSUL HAS RESIGNED
AND A NEW ONE IS TO BE
APPOINTED NEXT MONTH.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Conwell is still more interested, asks Enrico
where do I come in? Enrico says, indicating
Madame:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I AM HERE TO SEE THAT THE &#39;RIGHT&#39;
MAN IS APPOINTED.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Conwell says &quot;Oh ho,&quot; he sees and looks at
the Countess, who nods her approval. He then
asks her where he comes in. With more mysterious
looks, they get their heads very closely
together, and the Countess says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WHAT&#39;S THE MATTER WITH YOU FOR
CONSUL? THE PICKINGS ARE GOING TO
BE FINE FOR THE &#39;RIGHT MAN.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Conwell considers a moment, smiles quizzically
and shakes his head and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;NO, I&#39;M IN WRONG&mdash;THE SENATE
WOULDN&#39;T CONFIRM ME.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The Countess tries to argue with him but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
is obdurate and says there&#39;s no chance for him,
but as they are talking he is suddenly struck
with a brilliant idea. He says, &quot;Wait a minute.&quot;
They all wait and finally he speaks and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I&#39;VE GOT JUST THE MAN FOR YOU!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">They are all attention and eager to know who
it is. He indicates that this must be very much
on the quiet and then says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;OLD COLONEL BIRD&mdash;FINE RECORD&mdash;EASY
TO HANDLE&mdash;BEEN WAITING
THIRTY-FIVE YEARS FOR A JOB.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The Countess indicates that she knows old
Bird and tells Enrico that he is ideal, that they
couldn&#39;t do better. Enrico asks if he can be
handled when the time comes. Conwell swells
up and tells him to leave that to him. It&#39;s
the easiest thing in the world. Enrico turns to
Madame, who backs up Conwell and Enrico is
then satisfied. Conwell then speaks up and
says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I&#39;LL GO ALONG AS SECRETARY AND
KEEP MY EYE ON THE OLD BOY.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">They both express their approval of that, and
indicate that he will get part of the swag. The
Countess leans over and says rather tauntingly:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I SUPPOSE THE OLD BOY&#39;S DAUGHTER
WILL GO ALONG, TOO!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Conwell says he bets she will and winks the
other eye. The Countess laughs and Enrico
smiles, interested at the idea of a romance. He
and the Countess exchange glances. Conwell
then says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;REMEMBER&mdash;MUM&#39;S THE WORD UNTIL
AFTER THE APPOINTMENT IS MADE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">They all agree to that and put their heads
together and go on with their scheming. (Fade
out.)</p>

<p>T: AND SO IT CAME TO PASS&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>22. PARLOR COLONEL BIRD&#39;S HOUSE. (Fade
in.) An old trunk in the middle of the floor
and the Colonel and mammy are packing in his
books, papers, etc. The Colonel all full of business
and very busy. Rosalie is helping, but is
very sad over the matter.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span></p>

<p>23. EXTERIOR COLONEL BIRD&#39;S HOUSE.
Roland rushes down the street with a newspaper
in his hand, runs up the steps and rings the
bell.</p>

<p>24. PARLOR COLONEL BIRD&#39;S HOUSE. Rosalie
looks up quickly, thinking that this must be
Roland. Mammy starts for the door but Rosalie
tells her she will answer the bell, and she runs
out into hall.</p>

<p>25. HALLWAY COLONEL BIRD&#39;S HOUSE.
Rosalie runs to the door and opens it.</p>

<p>26. EXTERIOR COLONEL BIRD&#39;S HOUSE.
Rosalie opens the door, and Roland rushes in.</p>

<p>27. HALLWAY COLONEL BIRD&#39;S HOUSE.
Roland, full of excitement, grabs Rosalie, shows
her the article in the newspaper.</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;Article in newspaper stating that Colonel Bird
has been appointed Consul of Bunkonia and that
he is to leave for there immediately with his
daughter and his Secretary, James Conwell.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland asks Rosalie if this is true. Rosalie
nods her head sadly, says that it is and</p>

<p>SP:  &quot;I DIDN&#39;T KNOW A THING ABOUT IT
MYSELF UNTIL THIS MORNING.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland protests that she can&#39;t go away and
leave him, and Rosalie asks what she can do
and says that her father has waited for this all
his life and insists on taking her along. Roland
asks where her father is, she points into parlor,
and Roland tells her that he will see about
whether she will be taken away or not, and
full of worry, rushes into the parlor followed
by Rosalie.</p>

<p>28.  PARLOR COLONEL BIRD&#39;S HOUSE.
Colonel Bird is helping mammy pack and Roland
rushes in followed by Rosalie. He goes to the
Colonel and protests against taking his fianc&eacute;e
away from him. He puts his arm around Rosalie
and says that he wants to marry her now and
keep her. The Colonel can&#39;t see this at all, and
says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;IF YOU MARRY NOW, HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO SUPPORT HER?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Rosalie turns to Roland and says that is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
trouble&mdash;that her father won&#39;t let her stay there
and marry him because he can&#39;t support her.
Roland then turns to the Colonel and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;BUT, COLONEL, IN ANOTHER MONTH
EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Rosalie seconds the motion and tries to persuade
her father that everything will be all right,
but her father shakes his head, looks grimly at
Roland and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THAT&#39;S WHAT CLEVELAND SAID TO ME
IN &#39;89.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland looks discouraged and realizes that he
is up against a hard proposition in the old
Colonel, but tries to explain that if they can just
struggle along for a month he will have millions,
but the Colonel says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR INHERITANCE
RIGHT IN YOUR HAND, COME DOWN TO
BUNKONIA AND GET HER.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland, much discouraged, still tries to argue
with the old boy, but he cuts him off and goes
on about his work. Roland then turns to Rosalie,
who by this time is in tears. At the sight of
Rosalie&#39;s tears, Roland forgets his own disappointment,
and putting his arm around her, leads
her off to a secluded corner out of sight of the
old Colonel, seats her and tries to comfort her,
putting his arm around her and saying:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THE FIRST OF APRIL IS MY BIRTHDAY.
I GET MY INHERITANCE THAT DAY AND
I&#39;LL START AT ONCE FOR BUNKONIA.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">At once Rosalie looks up at him with her eyes
full of tears and smiles wanly. Roland takes
her hand, wipes away her tears, kisses her and
says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I&#39;LL SEND YOU A CABLE EVERY
DAY!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">At this Rosalie is greatly cheered up, she looks
and says: &quot;Will you, dear?&quot; and he assures her
that he will and again kisses her.  (Fade out.)</p>

<p>T: THE AMERICAN CABLE COMPANY DID
WELL THAT MONTH BUT LOOK WHAT
HAPPENED TO ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE.</p>

<p>29. HALLWAY ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE. (Fade in.)</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span></p>

<p class="indentedmargin">View of hall without a piece of furniture, bric-a-brac
or pictures. (Dissolve out.)</p>

<p>30. LIBRARY ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE. (Dissolve in.)
View of Library absolutely bare. (Dissolve out.)</p>

<p>31. ROLAND&#39;S BEDROOM. (Dissolve in.) Bedroom
has nothing in it but one couch, one chair
and a soap box on which are Roland&#39;s mirror
and toilet articles.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland is asleep on the couch. Presently
Briggs enters, looks about at the devastated
room, then shaking his head over the laziness
of his master, goes over, wakes Roland up and
says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I WISH YOU A HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SIR.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland wakes up, looks at him, rubs his eyes,
realizes that his probation is over. Tom enters
smiling with a telegram in his hand which he
gives to Roland who opens it and reads:</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;TELEGRAM.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">New York, March 31, 1920. &quot;Arrive Washington
four-forty to-morrow, April first, to deliver
inheritance. <span class="ralign">HOWE-GREENE.&quot;</span></p>


<p class="indentedmargin">Roland jumps out of bed, goes over and claps
Briggs on the back and shakes hands with him&mdash;then
shakes hands with Tom. Then makes Briggs
and Tom shake hands. Tells them both he&#39;s
going to have loads of money and they will be
paid. Roland then goes over to his soap box
on which is a calendar. He looks at page marked
&quot;March 31.&quot; Tears it off and looks at page
marked &quot;April 1.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He tears off the page with a flourish which
reads March 31st, turns it over, and, sitting on
the floor, writes on the back of it. Tom in the
meantime sends Briggs for his breakfast and
gets out Roland&#39;s clothes, brushing them with
great gusto. Roland finishes writing and reads
what he has written.</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;WHAT ROLAND IS WRITING.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">&quot;Miss Rosalie Bird, Santo Grafto, Bunkonia. At
last the great day is here. Lord Howe-Greene
arrives to-day with my inheritance. Leave for
Bunkonia to-morrow to claim you as my bride.
Roland.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span></p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He reads it and tells Tom to send it. Tom takes
the message. Scratches his head and looks
around the room for something to hock. Roland
wants to know why he&#39;s hesitating, and he tells
him. Roland then says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;TAKE THE COUCH!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom looks at the couch dubiously, then looks
at Roland and says: &quot;Where are you going to
sleep to-night?&quot; Roland, in an extravagant
manner and with a grand flourish, tells him to
take it away.</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I WON&#39;T BE ABLE TO SLEEP TO-NIGHT
ANYWAY!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom goes over, picks up the couch and starts
out of the room with it. At the door, Roland
stops him, picks up the one remaining chair,
hands it over to him and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;CABLE HER SOME ROSES WITH THIS!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom takes the chair, starts for the door when
he suddenly thinks of the fact that Lord Howe-Greene
is due that morning, so he stops, turns to
Roland and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WHAT DAT LORD HOWE-GREENE TO
SIT ON WHEN HE COMES?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland says that&#39;s right, so he leaves the chair
and starts out with the couch. Briggs in the
meantime has entered with Roland&#39;s breakfast.
Puts breakfast on soap box. Roland tells him
to put the chair down in the hall. Briggs doleful.
Roland slaps him on the back&mdash;tells him to cheer
up. Briggs goes out shaking his head and Roland
sits on chair and starts his breakfast all
smiles.  (Fade out.)</p>

<p>T: THE NEW MILLIONAIRE.</p>

<p>32. FRONT OF ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE. (Fade in.)
Roland&#39;s taxi drives up and stops, followed by
Tom&#39;s. Roland and Lord Howe-Greene with
portfolio get out. Tom also gets out with bags.
Howe-Greene starts up walk. Tom stops Roland
and shows him three cents&mdash;all he has and whispers
to him, saying:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;HOW DO I PAY THE TAXI?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland signifying that he can&#39;t be annoyed with
such little things, says grandiloquently:</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
SP: &quot;TELL THEM TO WAIT!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He follows Lord Howe-Greene up the walk
while Tom goes to the taxis and tells them to wait.
Then he follows with bags.</p>

<p>33. RECEPTION HALL ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">It is perfectly bare. Briggs is just coming down
the stairs carrying the one chair that is left, he
puts it down, looks around at the bare hall,
shakes his head sadly, dusts off the one chair,
then looks up quickly at hearing bell ring, goes
over to the door.</p>

<p>34. FRONT OF ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Briggs
opens the door and lets Roland and Lord Howe-Greene
in followed by Tom with bags.</p>

<p>35. HALLWAY ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland and
Lord Howe-Greene enter, followed by Tom and
Briggs. Briggs is delighted to see the old Englishman
but is terribly chagrined at the condition
of the house. He takes Lord Howe-Greene&#39;s
coat and hat, and Roland engages Lord Howe-Greene
in talking, then motions to Tom to get
the chair into the library. Tom sneaks the
chair around behind Lord Howe-Greene and into
the library.</p>

<p>36. LIBRARY.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom sneaks the chair in, puts it
down near the fireplace.</p>

<p>37. HALLWAY ROLAND&#39;S  HOUSE.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland
noticing that Tom has the chair placed, escorts
Lord Howe-Greene into the library with a grand
flourish.</p>

<p>38. LIBRARY.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom is standing behind the chair.
Lord Howe-Greene and Roland enter. Tom seats
Lord Howe-Greene very ceremoniously in the
chair. Lord Howe-Greene looks around the
empty room and is astounded. He turns to
Roland and says: &quot;<i>I say, old fellow, the place looks
rather beastly bare? Where&#39;s the furniture?</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland thinks for a moment, looks at Tom; Tom
does some quick heavy thinking and finally says,
very graciously:</p>

<p>SP:  &quot;WE SENT THE FURNITURE OUT TO BE
CLEANED IN HONOR OF YOUR COMING.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland smiles in relief and in approval of Tom,
and then says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
SP: &quot;THE CLEANERS ARE ON STRIKE SO
THEY DIDN&#39;T GET IT DONE IN TIME.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Lord Howe-Greene blandly accepts the explanation
and thanks him for his thoughtfulness.
Roland, who has been fondling the portfolio, can
hardly wait for it to be opened, and he gives it to
Lord Howe-Greene and then goes and stands by
the mantel with Tom. Lord Howe-Greene fishes
out the papers, finally comes to the will and
starts to read the glad news. He reads for a
moment and then</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;&quot;That providing said Roland Stone has carried
out previous instructions of the will, his
father provides as follows:&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland, overcome with impatience, begins to
get even more interested. Lord Howe-Greene
clears his throat and goes on reading:</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;&quot;I bequeath to my son, Roland Stone, one
unencumbered position in the Anglo-American
Insurance Co. as soliciting agent with a guarantee
of $25.00 per week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland looks in astonishment at Lord Howe-Greene
as does also Tom. Lord Howe-Greene
clears his throat again and goes on reading:</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;&quot;If at the end of one year, the business said
Roland Stone procures for the company has
proven profitable, the same will be a proof of
his good business judgment, and he is then to
come into possession of my entire fortune.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland stares simply open-mouthed in astonishment
and disappointment, while Tom can
hardly believe his ears.</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;&quot;If on the other hand, the company at the
end of one year has suffered a loss through the
agency of said Roland Stone, my entire fortune
shall be given to the support of the Washington
Home for Incurables.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland, absolutely dumbfounded by the news,
stares at Lord Howe-Greene, then looks around
at Tom. Tom looks at Roland accusingly.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland then turns in discouragement and asks
Lord Howe-Greene if there&#39;s any more. Lord
Howe-Greene goes on reading:</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;&quot;It is further provided that conditions under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
which said Roland Stone is to work, shall be
subject to the approval of Lord Howe-Greene.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland is utterly unable to take all of this in,
and he insists on reading it himself. Lord Howe-Greene
hands it to him, and Roland starts in to
read it as though he could hardly believe his
eyes. Tom looks over his shoulder, and, finally
disgusted with the whole proceeding, he goes
over toward the window, stands there dejectedly
and looks out.</p>

<p>39. STREET IN FRONT OF ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE.

a terrible shock on seeing the taxis and realizing
that they can&#39;t pay them. He then goes over
to Roland, and tells him that the two taxis are
out there, eating their heads off. Roland looks
out toward the window, thinks about the taxis,
then looks over to Lord Howe-Greene, who is
sitting comfortably in the last chair, thinks a
moment, then goes over to Lord Howe-Greene,
excuses himself, takes the chair from under the
utterly flabbergasted Lord Howe-Greene, gives
it to Tom and tells him to take it out to pay the
taxis. Tom takes the chair and goes out, Lord
Howe-Greene looking after him in wide-eyed
astonishment. Roland then turns to Lord Howe-Greene
and starts in to protest about the conditions
of the will, but Lord Howe-Greene tells
him that there is nothing that he can do. He
takes the papers from Roland. Sits on window
sill (especially built) and starts in to read the
long document to Roland. Roland trying to
follow Howe-Greene gets disgusted, leans against
wall and at length slips to floor and sits there
disconsolate, thinking of his rotten luck and of
the girl away off with his rival. (Dissolve out.)</p>

Roland, sitting in the corner, very much distressed
by the vision he has just seen.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Lord Howe-Greene is still sitting on window
sill reading document. Roland gives him a dirty
look, puts his hands on his ears and at length
jumps up and stalks out into the hall, leaving
Howe-Greene still reading.</p>

<p>43. HALLWAY&mdash;ROLAND&#39;S  HOUSE. Roland
rushes in from library, looks back disgusted at
Howe-Greene, who is still reading. At this moment
Tom enters from street, goes to Roland,
looks at him despondently, and says: &quot;<i>What are
we going to do now?</i>&quot; Roland puts his hand on
Tom&#39;s shoulder, and says with great emphasis:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;LOOK HERE, TOM, YOU&#39;VE GOT TO
THINK OF SOME WAY TO GET ME TO
ROSALIE!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom thinks a moment, finally his face brightens
and he says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;IF YOU&#39;VE GOT TO SELL INSURANCE,
WHY NOT SELL IT IN BUNKONIA?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland is delighted at this, and tells Tom he
knew he&#39;d think up a way out&mdash;that they can
start for Bunkonia to-morrow just as they had
planned. Tom says of course they can. Roland
says they will put it up to Lord Howe-Greene at
once and they go into the library.</p>

<p>44. LIBRARY, ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Lord Howe-Greene still sitting reading. Roland
and Tom enter, see him, and stop, both
disgusted. Howe-Greene finishes his reading.
Gets up and goes to them&mdash;gives Roland the
document, tells him it is very important for him
to keep it safe. Roland puts it in his pocket
then turns to Howe-Greene and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I&#39;VE BEEN THINKING THINGS OVER,
AND I&#39;VE DECIDED THAT IF I HAVE TO
SELL INSURANCE, I WOULD LIKE VERY
MUCH TO GET AWAY FROM WASHINGTON.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Lord Howe-Greene indicates that he understands
his feelings in the matter, thinks a moment
and says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
SP:  &quot;I HAVE IT! YOU SHALL TRY NEW
YORK.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland looks at him in utter astonishment and
says he is surprised that Lord Howe-Greene
would suggest such a terrible place to sell insurance.
He then turns to Tom and Tom agrees
with him. Roland then says to Lord Howe-Greene,</p>

<p>SP: &quot;NEW YORK WOULD NEVER DO! IT&#39;S A
TERRIBLE PLACE FOR INSURANCE!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Lord Howe-Greene is interested, and wants to
know why, and Roland goes on saying:</p>

<p>SP:  &quot;WHY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE
KILLED THERE DAILY!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Lord Howe-Greene is tremendously interested
and surprised and wants to know how. Roland
then goes on to describe the terrible life that
New Yorkers lead and we fade out.</p>

others on the head with mallets to get them
to move back. Everybody about him is mashed
flat but still he pushes more in. (Fade out.)</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland concludes his story about the terrible
life in New York and Lord Howe-Greene greatly
surprised at this says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;MY WORD!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland appeals to Tom for confirmation and
Tom nods his head and says that he hasn&#39;t heard
the half of it. Lord Howe-Greene shakes his
head, thinks a moment and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THEN YOU SHALL TRY CHICAGO!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland is surprised at his suggesting Chicago,
shakes his head, and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;CHICAGO IS WORSE. PEOPLE ARE
BLOWN TO DEATH IN CHICAGO BY
MILLIONS!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He turns to Tom and Tom confirms this and
Lord Howe-Greene, extremely puzzled and surprised,
wants to know how. Roland then goes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
on to describe a scene of how people are blown to
death in Chicago, along Michigan Avenue. (Fade

<p>INSERT&mdash;Animated Cartoon. (Fade in.) Michigan

and slammed up against walls where they

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland finishes his tale about Chicago, and Tom
agrees with him, shaking his head and saying:
&quot;It is indeed a terrible sight to see this thing
that Roland just described!&quot; Lord Howe-Greene
shows great distress, and shakes his head again
and exclaims:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;MY WORD!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland looks over at Tom and gives him a
wink. Tom gives Roland the high sign and the
two of them feel that things are going fine when
suddenly Lord Howe-Greene scratches his head
and gets a brilliant idea. He then tells Roland
that he has just the place for him and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I HAVE A COUSIN&mdash;A REAL ESTATE
AGENT IN LOS ANGELES&mdash;WHO WRITES
ME THAT THE CLIMATE IS SO SALUBRIOUS
THAT EVERY ONE LIVES TO A RIPE
OLD AGE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland looks at Lord Howe-Greene in astonishment,
feeling that he has been stuck at last.
Lord Howe-Greene then pats him on the shoulder
and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THAT&#39;S THE PLACE FOR YOU, MY BOY!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland looks genuinely alarmed and turns to
Tom for aid, but Tom himself is pretty much
stumped at this. Lord Howe-Greene feeling
that their problem has been settled, says that
that&#39;s exactly the place and everything will be
fine. Roland stalls, does some quick, heavy thinking,
finally gets an idea, and says: &quot;Lord Howe-Greene,
that&#39;s exactly where you&#39;re wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THE TROUBLE OUT THERE IS THAT
PEOPLE NEVER DIE. THEY WON&#39;T BUY
INSURANCE!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland is rather pleased with himself for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
thinking up this and Tom congratulates him on
it, smiling his approbation. Lord Howe-Greene
can hardly believe this angle of the situation,
says he doesn&#39;t think that&#39;s possible. Roland,
realizing that he has got to spike this says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WHY, I TRIED TO SELL INSURANCE
OUT THERE ONCE AND WHAT DO YOU
THINK HAPPENED?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Lord Howe-Greene is interested and wants to
know what did happen to him. Tom looks rather
quizzically at Roland, feeling that he is getting
out beyond his depth. Roland clears his throat
and starts in to describe what happened. (Fade
out.)</p>

<p>45. FRONT OF BUNGALOW IN LOS ANGELES.
(Fade in.)</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Three men with white whiskers to their waist
are playing leap-frog on the lawn. Roland comes
down the street, approaches one with an insurance
circular in his hand and asks if he could
interest him in some insurance. The old fellow
says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;NO, I DON&#39;T WANT ANY INSURANCE,
BUT YOU MIGHT SEE PA.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland is surprised that a man of his age
should have a father and asks where he is. The
old fellow points to the front door of the bungalow
and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;HE&#39;S HELPING GRANDPA CARRY THE
PIANO UP IN GRANDMA&#39;S ROOM.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland can hardly believe his ears at this and
says: &quot;What?&quot; The old man nods and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;YES, GRANDMA IS GOING TO TAKE
MUSIC LESSONS.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland looks aghast at the old man who goes
back to his leap-frog, and finally coming to,
goes up to the house and rings the bell while the
three old boys continue their leap-frog. Presently
a youthful looking Jap with long, white
whiskers opens the door. Roland asks for the
father and is shown in.</p>

<p>46. HALLWAY LOS ANGELES BUNGALOW.
Roland enters with the Jap servant. Pa and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
Grandpa&mdash;one with whiskers to the knees and
one with whiskers to the ankles&mdash;are lifting a
piano up the stairs. Roland approaches pa and
asks him if he could interest him in insurance.
Pa holds the piano with one hand, with the other
takes the young man&#39;s circular and looks at it.
He then shakes his head no, turns to grandpa
and says: &quot;Father, do you want any insurance?&quot;
Grandpa asks to see the circular and Pa hands it
up to him. Grandpa looks at it a minute, then
looks at Roland, shakes his head and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I THINK NOT, SON. I CAN LOOK AFTER
MY FAMILY FOR A FEW YEARS YET,
AND BY THAT TIME THEY&#39;LL BE ABLE
TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He hands the circular back to Roland and he
and Pa pick up the piano and go on upstairs,
Roland looking after them in absolute amazement.
(Fade out.)</p>

<p>47. LIBRARY, ROLAND&#39;S HOUSE. (Fade in.)
Roland finishes his story about Los Angeles.
Turns to Tom who confirms everything he has
said. Lord Howe-Greene, shaking his head in
amazement over these extraordinary conditions
in America, says very weakly&mdash;</p>

<p>SP: &quot;MY WORD&quot; (in very small type).</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">And Lord Howe-Greene is very much distressed.
He feels that this case is baffling him. He finally
looks up hopelessly and asks Roland what they&#39;re
going to do. Roland, puzzled, turns to Tom
and asks him what he thinks of the situation.
Tom thinks a moment, finally gets an idea, turns
to Lord Howe-Greene and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;IF YOU COULD ONLY GET HIM TO GO
DOWN TO BUNKONIA.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland pooh-poohs this idea and says no, he
never would, he couldn&#39;t go there because it is
too far away. But Tom goes on into raptures
about Bunkonia, telling him what a marvelous
place it is for business of all kinds, and Lord
Howe-Greene, glad of some solution to his problem,
finally jumps at the idea&mdash;turns to Roland
and says:</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
SP: &quot;THAT&#39;S AN IDEA! NEW COUNTRY&mdash;VIRGIN

FOR YOU!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland thinks a minute as though he had to
be convinced, but Lord Howe-Greene keeps on
begging him to take a chance. Tom joins Lord
Howe-Greene in urging him, and finally Roland
allows himself to be persuaded, decides that he
will go, Lord Howe-Greene shakes him warmly

standing about. One of the councilors has just
finished reading the text of a bill to raise the
taxes. King Caramba is sound asleep with a
bottle in his hand. Enrico, the only sober one
in the lot, is looking in a sinister, calculating way
around the table. The councilor who is reading
the bill sways as he reads and the paper jiggles
in his hand.</p>

Enrico, with a sinister smile, gets up and starts to

aloft to the other councilors who cheer in a
drunken manner. They all pour out another

calculating manner, then smiling a satisfied

matters more or less violently and waiting for
Enrico.</p>

<p>53. RENDEZVOUS AT GATE. Enrico enters,
looks about stealthily, sees that no one is watching
and then wraps three times on the gate. The
gate is opened by a villainous servant and Enrico
enters.</p>

<p>54. REVOLUTIONISTS&#39; RENDEZVOUS.  The
revolutionists are still talking together and they
see Enrico entering. They gather about him to
get the news and Enrico says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THEY WERE <i>ALL</i> DRUNK TO-NIGHT. IT
WILL SOON BE TIME TO STRIKE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">They all rejoice at this. Enrico asks the General
about the army and he replies:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;TWO HUNDRED OF THE ARMY ARE
WITH US NOW. IT WILL TAKE A HUNDRED
PESETAS TO WIN OVER THE
OTHER FIFTY.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Enrico is very angry at this, and asks him what
he means by a hundred pesetas, and is very sore
at the tremendous cost at buying these men.
The Countess stops his raving, putting her finger
over his lips, goes into her stocking, takes out
the money and gives the General two bills, which
amount to more than he has asked for. He then
turns to Conwell and starts in to talk. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
General puts the money in his pocket but Enrico
notices him and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;HERE! HERE! GIVE US THE CHANGE!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Reluctantly the General digs it up, starts to
pass it over to the Countess but Enrico stops
him before the Countess notices, grabs the money
and puts it in his own pocket. Enrico then
crosses over to Conwell and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;ARE YOU SURE WE CAN HANDLE OLD
BIRD WHEN WE&#39;RE READY?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Conwell tells him it&#39;s the easiest thing in the
world, that the old man has got to do just what
he says and winds up with:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;DIDN&#39;T I GET HIM THIS JOB?&quot;</p>

(Dissolve in.)  Colonel Bird is sitting
at his desk reading a political book. Mammy is
straightening room and dusting. Rosalie enters
dressed for the street. She goes to the Colonel,
looks over his shoulder, tells him that he works
too hard, makes him promise he will get some
rest and kisses him good-by and goes out.</p>

<p>56. CONWELL&#39;S ROOM IN THE CONSULATE.
Conwell is sitting at his desk very busily but
rather slyly making out a report. Rosalie comes
from her father&#39;s room, says good morning to
Conwell and starts to pass through. Conwell immediately
jumps to his feet, comes to her, and
stops her, admiring her dress, etc. Rosalie shows
by her attitude that she has begun to fear this
man. She starts to pass him but he takes her by
the hand, restrains her and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;HOW MUCH LONGER ARE YOU GOING
TO KEEP ME WAITING?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Rosalie is embarrassed and doesn&#39;t know what
to say. She tells him that she doesn&#39;t care about
him in that way and he finally says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;DON&#39;T YOU THINK YOU OWE ME SOMETHING
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
AFTER ALL I&#39;VE DONE FOR
YOUR FATHER?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">She expresses her gratitude for the help he has
been to her father but doesn&#39;t quite see why
she should marry him for that reason. Conwell
is getting impatient and finally says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;YOUR FATHER AS GOOD AS PROMISED
THAT YOU&#39;D MARRY ME.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Rosalie is surprised and incredulous, says she
doesn&#39;t believe it and turns and goes to the door.
Conwell tries to restrain her but doesn&#39;t succeed.
Rosalie calls in to her father and asks if he
will come in.</p>

<p>57. COLONEL BIRD&#39;S ROOM AT CONSULATE.
Colonel Bird puts down his book and goes in to
Conwell&#39;s room.</p>

<p>58. CONWELL&#39;S ROOM AT CONSULATE. Rosalie
looks up at her father almost in tears and
asks if he promised that she marry Conwell.
Colonel Bird berates Conwell for suggesting such
a thing, tells her she shall marry the man of
her choice. Conwell protests that Bird is indebted
to him for his job, Colonel Bird straightens
himself up with great dignity and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WELL, SIR, DIDN&#39;T I MAKE YOU MY
SECRETARY?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Conwell looks at him as much as to say&mdash;&quot;You
poor old simp&mdash;just wait.&quot; Colonel Bird
takes Rosalie to the door, kisses her good-by and
she goes out. He then turns to Conwell and
tells him to stop annoying his daughter.</p>

and goes down the street toward the station.</p>

<p>60. CONWELL&#39;S ROOM AT CONSULATE. Colonel
Bird is still laying down the law to Conwell
who nods his head, and Colonel Bird goes back
to his own room. Conwell looks after him in
a menacing way, then shakes his fist after him
and suggesting that he will get even with him
yet. He then gets his hat and goes out. (Fade

four natives, some kids and several pretty native
girls. Rosalie also is waiting. The train comes
in, a couple of soldiers get off and greet the girls.
Two natives get off and then Tom and Roland
get off. Rosalie rushes to them. Roland kisses
her, she greets Tom and leads them off.</p>

<p>63. FRONT OF HOTEL. (Fade in.) There are
several tables in front of the hotel and also
several booths and a sign over the entrance. Several
people are sitting at the tables drinking.
At one table sits the Countess and Enrico. Conwell
enters and joins them, rather sore over his
rebuff by Rosalie. They ask him why so grouchy
and he tells them. They give him the laugh but
Enrico slaps him on the back and tells him she
will come around all right. Waiters are going
in and out. A pretty girl is selling flowers, a
couple of musicians are playing guitars. Carriage
drives up with Rosalie, Roland and Tom. Tom
and Roland get out, a native porter comes from
the hotel and takes their bags into the hotel followed
by Tom, while Roland stops to speak to
Rosalie. Conwell looks up, sees Roland and is
very much disturbed. He calls the attention of his
two friends to Roland and tells them who he is
and they all look searchingly at him. Roland says
a very affectionate good-by to Rosalie and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;MAY I  COME TO SEE YOU THIS
EVENING?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Rosalie tells him that he may, bids him good-by
and he watches her drive away, sighs and turns
and goes into hotel. Conwell half hides so that
Roland won&#39;t see him. After he is well out of
sight Conwell starts to grumble at his ill luck at
having this fellow come down here. Enrico pats
him on the back, whispers in his ear and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WE CAN PUT HIM OUT OF THE WAY
DURING THE REVOLUTION.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span></p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The Countess nods that this will be easy but
Conwell looks doubtful, shakes his head and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;NO, IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR
US&mdash;HE&#39;S TOO WELL KNOWN IN WASHINGTON.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Conwell shows his anger and chagrin at the
turn of affairs. Enrico shrugs his shoulders but
the Countess starts in to think of some way out.</p>

The porter shows Tom and Roland in. Roland
is quite pleased with the place, tips the porter generously;
the porter leaves, followed by Tom and
his bag.</p>

<p>66. FRONT OF HOTEL. Conwell is still cursing
his luck. Enrico is sympathetic but helpless. The
Countess is thinking heavily and finally gets an
idea. She leans over, pats Conwell on the hand
and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THERE&#39;S SOMETHING ON EVERY MAN
IF YOU CAN ONLY FIND IT. LEAVE IT
TO ME. I&#39;LL FIND SOMETHING TO HANG
ON HIM.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Enrico approves of this, Conwell is slightly
interested and the Countess goes on explaining
that she has tackled many a difficult proposition
and won out. Just to leave it to her. (Fade out.)</p>

<p>T:  EVENING.</p>

<p>67. BEAUTIFUL COURTYARD OR GARDEN
AT THE CONSULATE.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland, dinner coat, and Rosalie, evening dress,
and the Colonel are there. Roland has just
finished telling the story of his dad&#39;s directions
regarding his fortune and he finishes up by saying
to Rosalie:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;SO WE&#39;VE GOT TO WAIT ANOTHER
YEAR, ROSALIE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">She takes his hand and says she doesn&#39;t mind
at all, she knows he&#39;ll be a great success. The
old Colonel comes to him, takes him by the
hand and says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
SP: &quot;I&#39;M GLAD SOMETHING HAS SET YOU TO
WORK, BUT YOU&#39;VE GOT TO WIN TO
GET ROSALIE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland thanks the Colonel, tells him he knows
it and that he&#39;s going to make good. The Colonel
rather brusquely tells him he hopes he does and
then leaves. Rosalie runs to Roland, tells him
she knows he&#39;s going to make good.</p>

<p>68. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ROLAND&#39;S APARTMENT.
The Countess enters, looks around
stealthily, goes to the door, tries it, finds it
locked, takes a hairpin from her hair, unlocks
the door with it, looks around and enters.</p>

<p>69. ROLAND&#39;S ROOM IN HOTEL. The Countess
in dark evening dress enters and closes the door.
Begins to rummage around among Roland&#39;s
things in his wardrobe trunk.  She finally uncovers
a lot of blank insurance policies. She
shows great interest in the discovery of the
papers, as papers are one of her main stock in
trade. She starts feverishly to examine them.</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;HANDFUL OF INSURANCE BLANKS.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The Countess looks at them in disgust, puts
them back where she found them and goes on
hunting.</p>

<p>70. GARDEN OF CONSULATE. Another very
beautiful shot with Rosalie and Roland standing
or sitting on a bench planning their future.</p>

<p>71.  ROLAND&#39;S BEDROOM IN HOTEL.  The
Countess still rummaging around. Down in the
bottom drawer of the trunk, she discovers a copy
of Roland&#39;s father&#39;s instructions which have been
given him by Lord Howe-Greene. She pounces
on this and reads it.</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;If at the end of one year the business said
Roland Stone procures for the company has
proven profitable, the same will be proof of his
good business judgment and he is then to come
into possession of my entire fortune.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Countess ponders over this a moment, then
reads next paragraph:</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;Part of statement as follows:</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">&quot;If, on the other hand, the company at the
end of one year has suffered a loss through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
agency of said Roland Stone, my entire fortune
shall be given to the support of the Washington
Home for Incurables.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The Countess gloats over this discovery, carefully
replaces everything just as she found it,
conceals the paper in her dress and stealthily
leaves the room.</p>

<p>72. EXTERIOR OF CONSULATE. Roland is just
bidding Rosalie good-night. She is expressing
her good wishes for his success. Roland looks
out toward the view of Bunkonia, then turns to
Rosalie and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WHY, IN A VIRGIN FIELD LIKE THIS, I
CAN&#39;T HELP BUT MAKE THE COMPANY
MONEY.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Rosalie is just as certain as he is about it.
He then goes on telling her that in just one
little year he will be claiming her. Rosalie is
delighted. Roland timidly kisses her, says good-night
and leaves. Rosalie looks after him and
sighs.</p>

<p>73. CAFE OF THE HOTEL. Enrico and Conwell
sitting at a table smoking and drinking. Conwell
is quite nervous and irritable. Enrico is trying
to jolly him up. The Countess enters in a very
mysterious way, sits beside them and tells them
with much glee but in great secretiveness that
she has great news. She stealthily draws the
paper from her dress and shows it to them.</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;SAME CLAUSE AS BEFORE WITH THE
COUNTESS&#39; FINGER POINTING TO IT.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Conwell and Enrico are puzzled over this, and
Conwell asks the Countess how it concerns him.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The Countess looks furtively about and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;DON&#39;T YOU SEE&mdash;IF HE LOSES MONEY
FOR THE COMPANY, HE LOSES THE
FORTUNE AND THE GIRL!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Enrico and Conwell consider this for a moment,
and finally realize the truth of it but ask the
Countess what she has in her bean. The Countess
looks furtively about and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WE&#39;LL HAVE HIM INSURE THE LIVES
OF THE KING AND COUNCIL.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Enrico and Conwell look at her, then at each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
other and ask what good that will do. The
Countess looks at them in a surprised way and
says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;AREN&#39;T THEY ALL TO BE KILLED IN
OUR REVOLUTION?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Slowly the force of this breaks over the minds
of Enrico and Conwell, their faces become
wreathed in smiles, at length both laugh boisterously.
Conwell takes the paper and looks at it
again, then rises, takes his glass, holds it out
toward the Countess and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;TO THE WOMEN&mdash;BLESS THEM. WHAT
WOULD WE DO WITHOUT THEM?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He and Enrico raise their glasses and drink
to the Countess who smiles and blushes. (Fade
out.)</p>

<p>T: THE NEXT MORNING&mdash;THE PLANT.</p>

<p>74. FRONT OF THE HOTEL. (Fade in.) Roland
is sitting at a table in the f.g. having his breakfast.
Conwell and Enrico come to the hotel
doorway and look out. They finally spot Roland.
Conwell then gives instructions to Enrico as to
what to do. He then goes out toward Roland
while Enrico backs into the hotel doorway and
waits. Conwell goes over to Roland, slaps him
on the back, greets him heartily. Roland rises,
rather embarrassed, Conwell shakes his hand
cordially and sits beside him. Enrico in the
doorway watches with a sinister smile. Conwell
asks Roland what he is doing down in Bunkonia.
Roland says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I&#39;VE COME DOWN TO SELL INSURANCE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Conwell is interested in this and Roland tells
him in a few words what he wants to do. Conwell
is quite interested and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;PERHAPS I CAN GIVE YOU A BOOST. I
KNOW ALL THE BIG GUNS DOWN
HERE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland is mildly interested but not overly
enthusiastic as he knows something of Conwell&#39;s
boasting proclivities. However he thanks him.
Conwell offers Roland a cigarette and while Roland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
is taking it, Conwell quickly signals to
Enrico. Enrico sees the signal and walks down
to the front of the hotel. Conwell looks up
sharply, pretending he has just seen Enrico,
points him out to Roland, who looks also, and
Conwell then speaks, saying:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THAT&#39;S ENRICO DE CASTANET, SECRETARY
OF WAR, AND A GREAT PAL OF
KING CARAMBA.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland is quite impressed. Conwell says he
will bring him over and gets up and goes over
toward Enrico. Enrico turns, sees him, greets
him very enthusiastically, saying, &quot;Ah, my
friend,&quot; shakes his hand and raises his hat at
the same time Conwell is doing it. Conwell
then asks him if he won&#39;t come over and meet
his friend, at the same time giving Enrico the
wink. Enrico says he will be pleased and they
both go over to Roland&#39;s table. Conwell introduces
Enrico to Roland. Enrico again
raises his hat. They all sit, Roland orders
drinks and Conwell briefly tells Enrico about
Roland&#39;s business. Enrico says he is interested
in any friend of Conwell&#39;s and after a
few words of explanation from Roland, Enrico
says to Conwell:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THERE&#39;S A MEETING OF THE COUNCIL
TO-NIGHT. WHY NOT BRING YOUR
FRIEND? I&#39;LL HAVE HIM MEET THE
KING.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland is quite overcome by all this kindness,
and Conwell says: &quot;<i>That is exactly the thing to
do</i>.&quot; Conwell takes his drink, holds it up and
says:</p>

<p>SP: HERE&#39;S HOPING YOU INSURE THE
LIVES OF THE KING AND ALL HIS
COUNCIL.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">They all drink to Roland&#39;s success. Roland is
overcome by their kindness. (Fade out.)</p>

<p>T: AT THE COUNCIL MEETING.</p>

<p>75. KING CARAMBA&#39;S COUNCIL ROOM. (Fade
in.) King Caramba and his councilors are there,
boozing as usual. Conwell is standing making a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
speech to them which they are not listening to
very intently. Conwell is telling them what a
great thing insurance is, and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;RIGHT AT YOUR VERY DOOR, GENTLEMEN,
IS A YOUNG YANKEE WHO IS
ABLE TO SELL YOU THIS WONDERFUL
LIFE INSURANCE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The councilors listen in a drunken way, all
except old Se&ntilde;or Frijole, who is very sore and
grouchy and signifies that he wants nothing to
do with this Yankee and his business. Enrico
rises to speak, telling them what a wonderful
thing insurance is, and then he says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WHY, DO YOU REALIZE, GENTLEMEN,
THAT WE GET THOUSANDS OF PESETAS
FOR A MERE FEW HUNDRED?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He turns to Conwell and asks him if he is right.
Conwell assures him he is right, and then continues
his speech. At this the Councilors begin
to take very much more interest. They signify
that this must be very good after all, all except
old Se&ntilde;or Frijole, who is sitting next to Enrico.
He pulls Enrico&#39;s sleeve and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;BUT YOU HAVE TO DIE TO GET IT&mdash;DON&#39;T
YOU?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Enrico gives him a quick, dirty look, tells him
to shut up, which squelches him somewhat, but
he goes on mumbling to himself. Conwell goes
on talking, saying that this opportunity should
not be overlooked. He sits down. Enrico says
he thinks it is a fine idea and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I&#39;LL TAKE 10,000 PESETAS MYSELF.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">At this the councilors are more interested
than ever as they know Enrico is not the type
to be done. Old Frijole goes on grumbling into
his glass of liquor saying he will have nothing
to do with it. Conwell goes over to the door,
opens it and goes out.</p>

<p>76. HALLWAY IN PALACE. Roland sitting on a
settee.  Conwell comes from Council Room.
Roland with application in his hand jumps up
nervously and meets him. Conwell tells him it
is all right and they go into Council Room.</p>

<p>77. COUNCIL ROOM. Conwell brings Roland in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
and introduces him to the councilors who greet
him, with drunken enthusiasm, while Conwell
stands in the background with a menacing leer.
Roland is very much pleased, but bashful, overcome
by his luck. Enrico, with a grand flourish,
asks Roland for an application which Roland
gives him, and he signs his own application with
a grand flourish and hands it over to Roland
as if to say&mdash;&quot;There, what more assurance do
you want that this is a good thing?&quot; At this
the other councilors all reach out drunkenly and
grab applications, Roland writing in the amounts,
and all of them signing the applications drunkenly.
Enrico and Conwell exchange triumphant
looks, but old Se&ntilde;or Frijole shows his disgust
for the entire affair. He finally goes up and
tries to keep the King from signing his application,
but the King gives him a push, he staggers
back into his chair, mumbling and grumbling
and warning them against Yankee tricks. By this
time, Roland has most of the applications signed,
Conwell comes up, pats him on the back and
congratulates him. (Fade out.)</p>

<p>T: ABOUT A WEEK LATER. (Fade in.)</p>

<p>78. COLONEL BIRD&#39;S ROOM IN CONSULATE.
Rosalie in simple evening dress is standing by
the window. Roland, in a blue coat and flannel
trousers, rushes in and Rosalie runs to him. He
tells her he has a surprise for her. She is very
much interested and wants to know what it is.
He says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I&#39;VE INSURED KING CARAMBA AND HIS
COUNCILORS FOR NEARLY A HUNDRED
THOUSAND DOLLARS.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Rosalie is amazed and delighted at this good
news. Roland says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I JUST DELIVERED THE POLICIES AND
COLLECTED THE PREMIUMS.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Rosalie is in ecstasies and throws her arm
around him and kisses him, much to his embarrassment,
although he is also greatly pleased.
Roland says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I WANT YOU TO COME OUT TO HELP
CELEBRATE MY GOOD FORTUNE.&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span></p>

<p class="indentedmargin">She is delighted, picks up a tulle scarf and
goes out with Roland.</p>

<p>79. CONWELL&#39;S ROOM IN CONSULATE. Conwell
is standing at desk as Roland and Rosalie
enter. Conwell turns to them smiling. Roland
stops and tells Rosalie Conwell&#39;s influence got
him his big clients. He goes to Conwell and
thanks him, shaking his hand. Rosalie is surprised
and puzzled that Conwell should help
Roland. Roland gets Rosalie and they go out
bidding Conwell good-night. Conwell looks
after them leering.</p>

<p>80. EXTERIOR CONSULATE. Roland and Rosalie
come out of the Consulate and leave in the
direction of the hotel.</p>

<p>81. REVOLUTIONISTS&#39; RENDEZVOUS. The
Countess, three other Revolutionists and about
thirty soldiers are there. They are all excited
and talking among themselves.</p>

<p>82. GATEWAY OF RENDEZVOUS. General enters
hurriedly and knocks three times&mdash;gate opens
and he quickly enters.</p>

<p>83. REVOLUTIONISTS&#39; RENDEZVOUS. Revolutionists
talking and awaiting somebody. The
general enters and joins group. He looks about
and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;ENRICO HAS JUST LEFT THE COUNCIL
MEETING. AS SOON AS HE COMES WE
STRIKE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He then leaves and goes to soldiers&mdash;the others
discuss this news excitedly.</p>

<p>84. GATEWAY OF RENDEZVOUS. A group of
six or eight soldiers, led by a sergeant, approach
skulkingly&mdash;the sergeant knocks at the gate,
which opens and the soldiers all sneak in.</p>

<p>85. EXTERIOR CONSULATE. Colonel enters
from opposite direction taken by Roland and
Rosalie and enters consulate. Four guards look
out from hiding places.</p>

<p>86. CAFE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL
(NIGHT). Several people at tables. Roland
and Rosalie enter and go into one of the little
booths and sit down&mdash;waiter comes and takes
their order&mdash;they are very happy.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span></p>

<p>87. EXTERIOR CONSULATE. Enrico enters,
whistles softly, and four guards sneak out of
hiding places and come to him. He asks if Colonel
Bird is home. They tell him he has just
gone in. He tells them to wait in the shadow
and they go into the shadow and Enrico, looking
about cautiously, goes to the porch and knocks
three times.</p>

<p>88. CONWELL&#39;S ROOM IN CONSULATE. Conwell
at desk hears knock, glances toward the
colonel&#39;s room and goes to the door, opens it.
Enrico quickly enters. Conwell closes the door.
Enrico asks him if the Colonel is in. He smiles
and says yes. Enrico tells him he has come to fix
old Bird. Conwell says: &quot;Easy&mdash;he&#39;ll do anything
you say,&quot; and tells him to wait a moment
and goes into the Colonel&#39;s room.</p>

<p>89. COLONEL&#39;S ROOM. Colonel at his desk.
Conwell enters, tells him that Enrico de Castanet
wishes to see him. Colonel somewhat surprised
and a little bit flattered, swells up a bit, tells Conwell
to show Se&ntilde;or de Castanet in. Conwell opens
the door and de Castanet enters. The Colonel
greets him and they sit down and Conwell goes out
and they begin to talk, Enrico telling him that
they are going to pull a revolution that night
and put King Caramba and his council out of
the way.</p>

<p>90. CAFE IN FRONT OF HOTEL. Roland and
Rosalie still dining, having a grand time. A couple
of revolutionists enter and sit in the booth next
to theirs.</p>

<p>91. COLONEL&#39;S ROOM. Enrico is talking very
earnestly to the Colonel. At length he says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;NOW IF YOU WILL ADVISE THE AMERICAN
PRESIDENT TO RECOGNIZE OUR
NEW GOVERNMENT TO-MORROW, IT
WILL MEAN ALMOST ANYTHING YOU
WISH TO ASK.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The old Colonel is puzzled and vaguely alarmed
at this, doesn&#39;t quite get it. Asks Enrico:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;ARE YOU OFFERING ME A BRIBE?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Enrico shrugs his shoulders and says if that
is what he chooses to call it. The old Colonel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
becomes very angry, rises at his desk, begins to
lay down the law to Enrico and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;YOU WOULD HAVE ME BARTER THE
HONOR OF MY COUNTRY? ARE YOU
AWARE, SIR, THAT YOU ARE DEALING
WITH <i>A LOYAL AMERICAN CITIZEN</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He bangs the table, stretches himself to his
full height. Enrico rises and tries to argue with
him, but the Colonel brushes him away and
grandiloquently points to American flag.</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THAT, SIR, IS THE GREATEST FLAG IN
THE WORLD, AND NO ACT OF MINE
SHALL EVER STAIN IT.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">At the finish of the speech, the old Colonel,
with a grand flourish, orders Enrico out of the
room. Enrico backs out, protesting all the way.
The old man kicking him out at the finish.</p>

<p>92. CONWELL&#39;S OFFICE. Conwell waiting expectantly.
Enrico lands in the room, to which he
has been catapulted by the old Colonel&#39;s foot.
Conwell comes to him, much perturbed.</p>

<p>93. COL. BIRD&#39;S ROOM AT THE CONSULATE.
Old Colonel slams the door and walks up and
down in excitement.</p>

<p>94. CONWELL&#39;S ROOM. Enrico angrily telling
Conwell what happened in the other room. Conwell
very sore and disgusted at the old man,
says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;HAVE YOUR GUARD KIDNAP HIM AND
LOCK HIM UP AND <i>I&#39;LL</i> TAKE CHARGE
OF THE CONSULATE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Enrico angrily approves of this and rushes
outdoors.</p>

<p>95. COLONEL&#39;S ROOM AT CONSULATE. Colonel
at his desk, rapidly writing a telegram,
presses button.</p>

<p>96. CONWELL&#39;S ROOM AT CONSULATE. Conwell,
looking out, hears the button, goes into the
Colonel&#39;s room.</p>

<p>97. COLONEL&#39;S ROOM AT CONSULATE. Colonel
finishing telegram, rises. Conwell comes to
him. Colonel indignantly tells him in a very
few words what has happened, points to the flag,
hammers his chest in great indignation, shows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
him a telegram which he is sending. Conwell
reads telegram:</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;TELEGRAM.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">TO CAPT. HENRY HALYARD, U. S. BATTLESHIP
UTAH, PORTO PUNKO, BUNKONIA.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">REVOLUTION THREATENED HERE TO-NIGHT.
SEND MARINES AT ONCE TO
PROTECT AMERICAN INTERESTS.</p>

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
BIRD,
CONSUL.
</div>

</div>

<p class="indentedmargin">Conwell smiles at this. The Colonel orders him
to send it at once and Conwell, still smiling,
starts to leave the room, when the door opens
and in bursts Enrico with his four guards. He
tells them to arrest the Colonel, which they do,
but the old boy puts up a fight. They finally
overcome him and hold him prisoner. He appeals
to Conwell, who only laughs at him and
tears up the telegram and throws it in his face,
shakes his finger at the old man and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WE SHALL SEE NOW WHO IS THE BOSS
AROUND HERE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The old Colonel is annoyed and tries to get
at Conwell but the guards hold him. Conwell
smiles and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WE SHALL SEE NOW WHETHER I GET
YOUR DAUGHTER OR NOT.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He tells the guard to rush the old man out,
which they do, followed by Conwell and Enrico.</p>

<p>98. CONWELL&#39;S ROOM IN CONSULATE. The
guards rush the old Colonel through the room
and out, followed by Conwell and Enrico.</p>

the old Colonel out followed by Enrico and Conwell.
Enrico tells the guard:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;LOCK HIM UP IN THE DUNGEONS
UNDER THE PALACE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He scribbles on a card that he gives to one
of the guards. The guards rush the Colonel off
toward the palace and Enrico and Conwell go
in the opposite direction, toward the rendezvous.</p>

<p>100. CAFE IN FRONT OF HOTEL. (Long shot)
showing the two booths, with Roland and Rosalie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
in one and the two revolutionists in the other.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP OF TABLE WITH ROLAND AND ROSALIE.
They are talking animatedly. Roland
has a little notebook in his hand, which he shows
to Rosalie and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THINK WHAT THIS MEANS TO US, ROSALIE!
I CAN&#39;T FAIL NOW.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Rosalie is delighted at the wonder of this&mdash;takes
his hand and they go on talking of their
plans.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP OF THE TABLE WITH THE REVOLUTIONISTS.
A third revolutionist officer comes
in hurriedly, sits down, looks about and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THE HOUR TO STRIKE IS AT HAND.&quot;
The other revolutionists listen.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP OF ROLAND AND ROSALIE. They are
pricking up their ears.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP OF REVOLUTIONISTS&#39; TABLE. One
asks the newcomer what is going to happen
and he says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THE REVOLUTION STARTS TO-NIGHT.&quot;
The other two gloat over this.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP&mdash;Roland and Rosalie listen, their alarm
growing, Roland climbs on chair and looks into
next booth.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">OTHER BOOTH&mdash;Roland looking over top, frightened.
The revolutionists go on talking, the newcomer
says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;KING CARAMBA AND HIS  COUNCIL
WILL BE KILLED FIRST.&quot;
They go on talking together.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP, ROLAND AND ROSALIE&mdash;Roland is dismayed
at what he has heard. Rosalie starts to
speak and he tells her to keep quiet and he listens
over the partition.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP, THREE REVOLUTIONISTS&mdash;They are
talking, call waiter, pay him and get up and
leave hurriedly. Roland ducks down.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP OF ROLAND&mdash;Finally he realizes what is
to happen, and that it means ruin and he turns
to Rosalie and says:</p>

<p>SP:  &quot;THEY ARE GOING TO KILL EVERY ONE
I&#39;VE INSURED.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">They are both terribly alarmed and realize
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
that this means ruin for their hopes. They don&#39;t
know what to do, at length Rosalie says:</p>

<p>SP:  &quot;WE MUST HAVE FATHER SEND FOR
HELP.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland in his terror agrees to this&mdash;he throws
a bill on the table, she grabs him by the hand and
they rush out.</p>

<p>101. EXTERIOR REVOLUTIONISTS&#39; RENDEZVOUS&mdash;Enrico
and Conwell enter. Enrico
knocks on door three times, the door is opened
and they enter.</p>

<p>102. REVOLUTIONISTS&#39; RENDEZVOUS. Enrico
and Conwell enter and join Countess and General
and tell them the time has come to strike&mdash;that
old Bird refused Enrico&#39;s request, that they
chucked him in prison and Conwell now is boss

<p>106. COL. BIRD&#39;S ROOM AT CONSULATE. Roland
and Rosalie rush in&mdash;see the overturned
furniture and realize something has happened.
Mammy enters from back door. Rosalie runs to
her and asks what has happened and she doesn&#39;t
know. Rosalie asks Mammy where her father is.
Mammy says she left him here. Rosalie is terrified.
Rosalie and the old servant rush out. Rosalie
upstairs and Mammy to kitchen to look for
the Colonel. Roland picks up the bits of the
telegram from the floor and pieces them together.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Rosalie comes back into the room and the old
servant enters and shakes her head. Rosalie in
terror, says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;FATHER IS NOT HERE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland thinks a moment, realizes that they have
taken him away, shows his anger at this, calls
Rosalie to him, finishes piecing the telegram together
and then reads it.</p>

<p>INSERT OF TELEGRAM PIECED TOGETHER.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span></p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Rosalie having read the telegram shows hope
in her face and says to Roland:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;YOU MUST SEND THAT MESSAGE AT
ONCE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland jumps at this and gathers up the pieces
in his hand, starts to go, then thinks of the
girl, stops and asks her what she will do in the
meantime. She says never to mind, but to go on,
old Mammy will stay with her. Roland is reluctant
to go, but Rosalie goes to the drawer of the
desk, takes out her father&#39;s old army revolver,
and then goes to Roland and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I AM AN AMERICAN GIRL AND CAN
TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">She tells him to go and forces him out toward
the door. He takes her in his arms and kisses
her and rushes out. The old mammy comes to
her and puts her arm about her.</p>

<p>107. FRONT OF CONSULATE&mdash;Roland rushes out
and down the street toward the station.</p>

<p>108. REVOLUTIONISTS&#39; RENDEZVOUS. The
Countess, the General and a few other officers,
about 100 soldiers and a major are there. Enrico
is giving his instructions to the various people.
Conwell and Enrico enter. Conwell tells Countess,
General and others what has happened and
tells them what to do. Conwell says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;LOOK HERE, WHAT ABOUT THE GIRL?
I WANT HER ABDUCTED AND KEPT FOR
ME IN THE PALACE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Enrico says that&#39;s all right&mdash;tells the general
to put a guard at the disposal of Conwell. Conwell
and the general leave&mdash;go to soldiers. Enrico
tells Countess to look after the girl when
she gets to the palace. Countess says she will
and Enrico goes on talking to others.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">About 100 soldiers are there. Conwell and
General enter. General selects a guard of about
three men. Tells them to obey Conwell&#39;s orders
and Conwell leaves with the three men. The
General then turns to the rest of the soldiers
instructing them as to what they are to do.</p>

<p>109. EXTERIOR R. R. STATION. Roland runs in
and enters station.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span></p>

OFFICE. Roland rushes in and tells
station master he wants to send a message. Starts
to write it. Station master stops him&mdash;says he
cannot send message. Roland asks why. Station
master points to telegraph instrument.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP OF TELEGRAPH INSTRUMENT SMASHED.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland asks who did that. Station master says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THE REVOLUTIONISTS.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland is nonplused for the moment&mdash;rushes
out of the door, followed by the station master.</p>

<p>111. EXTERIOR R. R. STATION. Roland rushes
out followed by station master. Roland runs in
the direction of the hotel. Station master looks
after him and bites his thumb at him, then goes
back into station.</p>

<p>112. EXTERIOR WINDOW SIDE OF CONSULATE.
Conwell sneaks in with his three soldiers
and peeks in window and sees&mdash;</p>

<p>113. COL. BIRD&#39;S ROOM IN CONSULATE&mdash;Rosalie
sitting tense holding gun and watching
door. Mammy beside her standing.</p>

<p>114. EXTERIOR WINDOW SIDE OF CONSULATE.
Conwell shows his chagrin at the fact
of Rosalie&#39;s having a gun, thinks a moment, then
tells his guard to keep very quiet and follow
him. He sneaks out toward front of house, followed
by guard very quietly.</p>

<p>115. CAFE IN FRONT OF HOTEL. Tom is sitting
in one of the booths shooting craps with a
native civilian. Roland rushes in, tells Tom about
the revolution, says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WE&#39;VE GOT TO SAVE ALL THOSE GINKS
I INSURED.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He grabs Tom and they rush out of the cafe
toward the palace leaving the native flat.</p>

<p>118. CONWELL&#39;S ROOM IN CONSULATE. Conwell,
with his three guards, enter stealthily. He
places the three guards against the wall on each
side of the door leading to the Colonel&#39;s room
and he then knocks on the door.</p>

<p>117. COLONEL&#39;S ROOM IN CONSULATE. Rosalie,
terrified, says: &quot;Who is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span></p>

<p>118. CONWELL&#39;S ROOM IN CONSULATE. Conwell
says, &quot;It&#39;s I&mdash;Jim Conwell.&quot;</p>

<p>119.  COLONEL&#39;S ROOM IN CONSULATE. Rosalie,
greatly relieved, lowers gun and says, &quot;come
in.&quot; Conwell enters, leaving the door open. He
smiles ingratiatingly and comes forward.  She
asks him if he knows where her father is. He
doesn&#39;t know, but pats her reassuringly on the
shoulder and gently takes the revolver from her.
In this position he whistles. The girl looks up
quickly and jumps to her feet in alarm, but before
she can make any move, the three guards rush
in and seize her. Conwell steps to her and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;DON&#39;T BE ALARMED, THESE GENTLEMEN
WILL ESCORT YOU TO THE KING&#39;S
PALACE WHERE OUR WEDDING WILL
TAKE PLACE TO-MORROW MORNING.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Rosalie is horrified at this and starts to struggle,
but the men hold her and start to take her out of
the room. The old Mammy grabs a big book
and lambasts Conwell over the head, stunning
him for a moment. She then runs for the guards,
jumping on their backs like a cat. By this time
Conwell has regained his feet, grabs the colored
servant and bangs her on the head with something
heavy, then chucks her over into a corner
and he follows the guards and Rosalie out
through a back door.</p>

<p>120. BACK DOOR OF CONSULATE.  Conwell
rushes out followed by the three guards dragging
Rosalie. They start toward palace but Conwell
stops them and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WE&#39;LL KEEP HER IN OUR RENDEZVOUS
UNTIL ENRICO CAPTURES THE PALACE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">They all exit in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>121. REVOLUTIONISTS&#39; RENDEZVOUS. Enrico
is there with the General, Major and Countess.
Enrico is haranguing the soldiers, giving them
final instructions. They all cheer. Enrico calls
Major to him and tells him to look after the
Countess and after they have captured the palace
to bring her there. Major salutes and steps aside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
with Countess. Enrico goes on haranguing the
soldiers and at length says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;AND REMEMBER THERE IS A PRICE
OF THIRTY PESETAS ON THE HEAD OF
THE KING!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">They all cheer. Enrico draws his sword and
says:</p>

<p>SP:  &quot;ON TO THE PALACE!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He gives orders to fall in, which they do,
then forward march. They all march out led by
Enrico, the Countess and Major looking after
them.</p>

<p>T:  THIRTY PESETAS&#39; WORTH OF ROYALTY.</p>

<p>122. KING&#39;S BEDCHAMBER. Councilors standing
by bed all salute drunkenly. Two lackeys carry
the King (who is dressed in a long white night
gown and night cap and hugging a bottle of
booze to his chest) and chuck him on the bed,
cover him up and stand. The king dozes off
into a drunken stupor. Councilors salute and
stagger out toward Council Room (followed by
lackeys).</p>

<p>123. HALLWAY IN PALACE. Councilors stagger
out of King&#39;s bedroom across hall and into
Council Room.</p>

<p>124. COUNCIL ROOM IN PALACE. Councilors
stagger in and sit at table and begin boozing&mdash;drinking
to:</p>

<p>SP:  &quot;GOOD REST TO HIS MAJESTY.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">They all down a drink and sit down.</p>

<p>125. FRONT DOOR OF PALACE.  Two royal
guards on duty (uniforms elaborate and different
from those of the army). Roland and Tom rush
up and demand admittance and are refused. Roland
says it is very important to see the king,
but they won&#39;t let him in. Tom wants to wallop
them on the nose and go in, but is restrained by
their guns and finally he and Roland leave in
disgust and go down to the edge of the grounds,
then look back and see the guards are not looking
and beat it around to the side of the palace.</p>

<p>126. STREET. Enrico, the General and soldiers
march through toward palace.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span></p>

<p>129. BACK OF PALACE. Roland and Tom run in.
Tom leans down and makes a stepping stone for
Roland, who jumps from his back to window,
pushes it open and crawls in. He then pulls Tom
up after him.</p>

<p>130. HALLWAY OF PALACE LOOKING TOWARD
THE BACK. Roland and Tom crawl
in the window, quickly look about, rush into the
Council Room.</p>

<p>131. COUNCIL CHAMBER. Councilors all drunk.
Tom and Roland rush in from hall, tell them
there is a revolution on and they&#39;ve got to beat
it to save their hides as the soldiers and revolutionists
are coming. They all get up in a
drunken, stupid sort of way&mdash;don&#39;t take it in.
Two lackeys rush out the window at back. Roland
demands of one of the councilors:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WHERE IS THE KING?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The councilor, half soused, points across the
hall. Roland and Tom stir up the councilors
and drive them out into the hall. One of them is
too far gone to walk. Roland pitches him over
to Tom who throws him over his shoulder and
carries him out. Little Frijole, the grouch, is the
soberest of the lot and realizes the situation and
tries to follow along, but Roland gives him a
shove and lands him in a chair, saying:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;GET AWAY! YOU&#39;RE NOT INSURED.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">They all go out into the hall, Frijole getting up
and following. As he does so, he draws an old
revolver out of his pocket.</p>

<p>132. HALLWAY IN THE PALACE. They all cross
the hallway to the king&#39;s bedroom&mdash;Tom carrying
his councilor, Frijole following, waving his revolver.</p>

<p>133. KING&#39;S BEDROOM. They all rush in&mdash;Tom
carrying the same councilor and Frijole waving
his revolver. Roland rushes to the king&#39;s bed
and wakes him up while the councilors stagger
about stupidly, bumping into each other and not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
yet fully realizing what&#39;s up. Tom drops his
councilor on a couch or floor. Roland wakes
the king up&mdash;pulls him out of bed&mdash;tells him
that the revolutionists are coming and he has
got to get out. The King is very stupid from
drink and doesn&#39;t take it in. Roland shakes him
and tries to make him understand.</p>

<p>134. STREET CORNER NEARER THE PALACE.
Enrico, the General and army march through.</p>

<p>135. KING&#39;S BEDROOM. Roland, trying to make
old King Caramba understand, says to Tom:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;GET SOME WATER.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom leaves. Roland goes on shaking the King.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP OF LITTLE PRIVATE SIDEBOARD OR
BAR in corner of room. Tom rushes in, looks
for water but there is none. He turns and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;EVERYTHING HERE <i>BUT</i> WATAH!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland says to bring a bottle of something.
Tom takes a bottle of champagne, knocks neck
off of it and goes toward bed.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP BY BED&mdash;Roland still trying to bring King
to. Tom enters with champagne. Roland takes
it and souses it in King&#39;s face&mdash;King falls back
on bed. Roland and Tom pull him up again to
his feet. King licks champagne from his face
with tongue. They punch, pummel and slap him
and finally bring him to. Roland tells him about
the revolution&mdash;that they must get out of the
palace and hide. The King looks around and
sees the various councilors. Finally realizes what
is up&mdash;asks where the Revolutionists are.</p>

<p>136. FRONT OF PALACE. Two royal guards sleeping
on ground.  Enrico, General and soldiers
march in. Royal guards are overpowered and
Enrico, General and soldiers begin to bang on
door.</p>

<p>137. KING&#39;S BEDROOM IN PALACE.  Roland
tells him they are rushing on the Palace. The
old King is scared blue&mdash;begins to shake and
tremble. Roland asks him if he doesn&#39;t know
some way to get out. Finally the old King comes
to his senses enough to remember a trap door
under the flagging of the floor. He takes Roland
over to the place in the floor and points down there.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span></p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland and Tom look and see nothing but flagging.
The old King keeps pointing and poking
with his toe, says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;STAIRWAY UNDER THERE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Finally Roland taps the flagging with his heel.
Then he and Tom get down on their knees and
try to pull up the stone. It won&#39;t come. They
look up at the King. He says, yes, that&#39;s the
place.</p>

<p>SP: &quot;TUNNEL&mdash;LEADS TO EL JUGGO
PRISON.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom then gets a big jack-knife from his pocket,
opens it and begins to pry up the flagging. The
old King claps his hands and nods his head.
Roland and Tom continue pulling up the flagging
from the floor.</p>

<p>138. FRONT OF THE PALACE. Enrico, the General
and soldiers banging on the door.</p>

<p>139. THE KING&#39;S BEDROOM. Roland finishes
pulling up the last stone. Tom chucks the stones
under the bed. Roland then raises the trap door,
starts to shove the Councilors down.</p>

<p>140. FRONT OF THE PALACE. Soldiers still
banging on the door trying to break it down.</p>

<p>141. THE KING&#39;S BEDCHAMBER. Roland is
shooing the King and Councilors down the stairway.
Frijole keeps butting in and Roland pushing
him back.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP OF THE STAIRWAY. Frijole is trying to
push himself down, but Roland holds him back
and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I TOLD YOU TO KEEP OUT OF THIS&mdash;YOU&#39;RE
NOT INSURED.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">But Frijole insists that he shall go and raises
his revolver at Roland. Roland ducks and knocks
the revolver out of his hand. Tom picks it up.
Roland pushes Frijole over to Tom, who picks
up the little man and drops him out of the
window.</p>

<p>142. FRONT OF PALACE. Soldiers still banging
on the door&mdash;door breaks through and they enter.</p>

<p>143. KING&#39;S BEDCHAMBER IN PALACE. Tom
runs to door to hall, opens it a crack and peeks

<p>144. HALLWAY OF PALACE (front end). Soldiers
rush in. Enrico is holding his soldiers at the
door, through which they have broken, telling
them just where to go.</p>

to look. Roland comes to the door and looks.</p>

<p>146. HALLWAY IN PALACE. Enrico giving instructions
to his men.</p>

<p>147. KING&#39;S BEDROOM. Tom aims revolver at
Enrico. Roland stops him and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;FOR GOD&#39;S SAKE DON&#39;T KILL <i>HIM</i>.
HE&#39;S INSURED FOR TEN THOUSAND
DOLLARS.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He grabs Tom, closes the door and locks it,
pulls Tom away.</p>

<p>148. HALLWAY. Enrico, with a flourish, leads his
men down the hall toward the King&#39;s bedroom.</p>

<p>149. KING&#39;S BEDROOM. Tom picks up his councilor
and starts down through trap with him.
Roland quickly removing traces of the broken
floor, takes a rug and pulls it to the back of the
trap door.</p>

<p>150. HALLWAY OF PALACE. Enrico and part of
his soldiers are beating down the door of the
King&#39;s chamber&mdash;the rest going to the council
chamber.</p>

<p>151. KING&#39;S BEDCHAMBER. He closes the trap
just as the door breaks open and Enrico rushes
in with his soldiers. Enrico rushes to the bed,
sees the King is gone, looks angrily all about
the room, points toward the council chamber
and they all rush out.</p>

<p>152. COUNCIL CHAMBER. Soldiers with General
looking about coming in from door leading to
other rooms where they have found nothing.
Enrico enters, followed by soldiers, discovers
there is nobody there. He meets the General
and they are much puzzled as to who could have
tipped off the King and let him escape. The
General shrugs his shoulders, says if they have
escaped, Enrico can proclaim himself dictator.
Enrico goes to the head of the council table, the
General on his right raising his sword and
shouting:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
SP: &quot;THE KING AND COUNCIL HAVING
FLED, SENOR DE CASTANET PROCLAIMS
HIMSELF DICTATOR OF BUNKONIA!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Soldiers wave their hats, officers their swords,
and all acclaim him dictator. He starts to make
a speech and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;GENERAL, OUR FIRST MOVE MUST BE
TO CAPTURE AND SHOOT OUR RENEGADE
KING AND HIS COUNCIL.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The General approves and calls an officer and
tells him to take a troop and go after the King.

beating on the door.</p>

<p>157. HALLWAY OF JAIL. The guard, amazed at
hearing the noise outside this door, gets up, unlocks
the big lock and opens the door. Roland
rushes in with the King on his arm, followed
by the four Councilors, Tom carrying one. The
guard is dumbfounded at seeing all these notables
coming through the tunnel and asks what the
trouble is. Roland tells him there is a revolution.
He looks closely at the King, realizes who it is,
drops on his knees and kisses the King&#39;s hand.
Roland pulls him up to his feet and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I WANT YOU TO LOCK THIS WHOLE
GANG UP UNTIL I CAN GET HELP!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The guard looks at Roland then at the King
and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;LOCK UP MY KING&mdash;NEVER!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He then kneels down and kisses the King&#39;s
hand. Roland again pulls him to his feet, takes
him aside and gives him a couple of pesetas.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span></p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The guard says, &quot;Sure, that&#39;s all right,&quot; grabs
the King and hustles him and others down corridor,

Tom to stay with them. Tom follows them down
the corridor and Roland beats it out of the front
of the jail.</p>

about. Countess enters with Colonel, Conwell,
Rosalie and guards. Countess is escorted by
Colonel to Enrico, who kisses her hand and steps
over to Rosalie, who is with Conwell. She is
terribly frightened but Enrico leers at her and
tells her she has nothing to fear. Then turns to
the party and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;LET US DRINK TO OUR LITTLE BRIDE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">They all take glasses. Conwell raises glass to
Rosalie and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;TO-MORROW AT TEN.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">They all drink to Rosalie, who stands shivering
pitifully. (Quick fade out.)</p>

and rushes in the Consulate.</p>

<p>161. COLONEL&#39;S ROOM IN CONSULATE&mdash;Old
mammy lying unconscious where Conwell had
thrown her. Roland rushes in, is alarmed at
seeing the girl gone. He goes to mammy, raises
her up, shakes her, rubs her hands and slaps them,
trying to bring her to.</p>

<p>162. STREET. Tom runs through desperately.</p>

<p>163. COLONEL&#39;S ROOM IN CONSULATE. Roland
is giving mammy a drink of water. She
opens her eyes and slowly comes to. He puts
her in a chair and asks her what has happened.
She pulls herself together and says that Conwell
was there with soldiers&mdash;says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THEY TOOK HER TO THE KING&#39;S PALACE!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE HER
MARRY CONWELL IN THE MORNING!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland shows his alarm and anger, is stumped
for a moment. The old mammy begs him to save
her girl. Roland thinks for a minute what is best
to do.</p>

rushes into the house.</p>

<p>165. COLONEL&#39;S ROOM IN CONSULATE. Roland

breath points hand and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THE REVOLUTIONISTS PAID THE JAIL
GUARD TEN PEZITS AND HE TURNED
OVER THE KING AND HIS WHOLE GANG
TO THEM!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland is in despair at this news. Tom still
panting, says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THEY ARE GOING TO SHOOT THEM
ALL IN THE MORNING!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland is utterly flabbergasted at this, looks
bewildered at Tom and the old mammy and
finally says to Tom that they have Rosalie in
the palace and are going to make her marry
Conwell. Tom is open mouthed at this news.
At length Roland says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THERE&#39;S ONLY ONE CHANCE&mdash;WE
MUST GO TO PORTO PUNKO AND GET
THE MARINES!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom and the old mammy are very much interested
in this and urge him to try it and Roland
asks mammy if she is all right. She says she
is and tells them to go on. Tom and Roland
beat it out toward the front. She looks after
them.</p>

come out and rush down the street toward the

released. The soldiers spit at him and go out.</p>

and quickly enter the station.</p>

<p>169. INTERIOR R. R. STATION. Roland and Tom
rush in. Roland asks the station master when
the next train goes to Porto Punko.  Station
master laughs sardonically and replies:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;NO TRAINS TO PORTO PUNKO TO-NIGHT!
THE REVOLUTION LEADERS
HAVE GIVEN ORDERS THAT NO ONE
SHALL LEAVE TOWN!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He laughs again at Tom and Roland. Roland
looks at Tom in alarm then asks the station master
if he is sure. Station master says of course he&#39;s
sure. Roland steps out of back door. Tom starts
an altercation with the station master, telling him
he is too fresh, etc.</p>

<p>170. EXTERIOR BACK OF STATION. Roland
comes out and looks around in desperation. Sees
native riding by on an old bony horse, runs to him
and tries to hire horse.</p>

car, get off and run into station.</p>

<p>173. INTERIOR R. R. STATION. Tom is pounding
station master&#39;s head on counter as two officers
enter. They see him, draw their revolvers and
shout, &quot;Throw up your hands.&quot; Tom stops

They make him turn toward front door and while
one covers him the other talks excitedly to station
master.</p>

<p>174. EXTERIOR BACK OF R. R. STATION. Roland
trying to bribe native to give him horse, but
native refuses and rides off. Roland turns and

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
177. INTERIOR R. R. STATION. Officer finishes
his talk with station master, covers Tom also and
they start to march him toward front door. Roland
rushes in and fairly catapults himself on

and Tom rush out front door jumping over
officers.</p>

Roland falls and Tom stops to help him. The
two officers run up to them followed by station
master. They stick Tom up again and jerk Roland
to his feet. Roland loses his hat and puts
his hand to his head. He has only a scalp wound.
Two common soldiers run in from opposite direction&mdash;attracted
by shots. One of the officers says
to them:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;TAKE THEM TO THE PALACE DUNGEON
AND LOCK THEM UP.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The two soldiers start off with Roland and
Tom. The officer says, &quot;wait a minute&quot;&mdash;they
stop. He speaks to the other officer who nods
his head. The first officer then says to Tom:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;YOU COME WITH US.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He tells the two soldiers to take Roland off,
which they do. The two officers then march Tom
off to the hand car, followed by station master.
Arrived at the hand car one of them says to
Tom:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;GET ON THERE AND PUMP THAT CAR.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom and two officers get on hand car. Officers
cover Tom with their revolvers. The station
master says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WHERE ARE YOU GOING?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">One of the officers turns to him and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;TO PORTO PUNKO.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">At this Tom&#39;s face lights up and he begins to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
pump like mad and the hand car goes down the
track in opposite direction to one of train in
scene. Station master waves his hand to them
and exits to station. (Fade out.)</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">NEXT MORNING.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">THE FATAL HOUR APPROACHES.</p>

<p>181. PLAZA&mdash;FRONT OF PALACE. Soldiers are
lined up in front of palace. Populace in native
costumes are running about talking excitedly and
reading placards which are posted all about.</p>

<p>INSERT&mdash;PLACARD (in fake language).</p>

<p class="indentedmargin"><i>PROKLAMATIONIZ</i>
BINGUS DE SPOLIO KAYITZ! ETC.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">DISSOLVE INTO ENGLISH WHICH READS:</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">PROCLAMATION
EX REX CARAMBA AND HIS COUNCIL
HAVE DESERTED THEIR PEOPLE. ENRICO
DE CASTANET HAS BEEN PROCLAIMED
DICTATOR BY UNANIMOUS
VOTE OF THE ARMY. CARAMBA AND
HIS COUNCIL WILL BE SHOT AT TEN.
ALL TAXES WILL BE RAISED TWENTY
PER CENT AT TEN-THIRTY.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The people are frightened at this and call others
to read.</p>

<p>182. COURTYARD BACK OF PALACE. Officer
enters from palace with sixteen soldiers. He
picks out ten for a firing squad. He goes to the
wall and paces off a distance, then lines up his
firing squad. He then takes the other six and
goes back into the palace.</p>

<p>183. COUNCIL ROOM. Enrico enters with Magistrate
carrying a book. Enrico leads him across
the room and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THE WEDDING TAKES PLACE HERE!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The Magistrate says &quot;all right&quot; and gets
ready.</p>

<p>184. DUNGEONS UNDER PALACE. Conwell and
guards with guns enter and open the door of
cell and drag Roland out leaving old Colonel in.
They lock the door. Roland reaches through
the bars and grasps Bird&#39;s hand, saying &quot;Good-by.&quot;
They take out Roland, who has a handkerchief
tied around his head. March out. Roland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
then straightens up and marches out like a
Sidney Carton.</p>

<p>185. COUNCIL ROOM. Enrico and Magistrate are
waiting (no guns on anybody in this scene).
Countess enters with Rosalie who is terrified and
completely cowed. Enrico goes to her, pinches
her cheek and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WELL, HAVE YOU MADE UP YOUR
MIND TO MARRY CONWELL?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">She weakly shakes her head and says she
doesn&#39;t know what to do. Enrico smiles and
says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;SO YOU&#39;D RATHER SEE YOUR FATHER
KILLED, WOULD YOU?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">She miserably shakes her head and says &quot;No.&quot;
Enrico pats her on the shoulder and says:
&quot;That&#39;s a sensible little girl.&quot;</p>

<p>186. HALL OF PALACE. Roland, with two guards
and Conwell, comes up the stairs and they march
to the door of council room and stop. Conwell
smiles at Roland and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;I DID YOU A GOOD TURN, NOW YOU
ARE GOING TO DO ME ONE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Roland looks at him suspiciously and Conwell
still smiling, says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;YOU&#39;RE GOING TO BE BEST MAN AT MY
WEDDING.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He then throws the door wide open and indicates
the wedding party on the opposite side of
the room, with a flourish. Roland looks in astounded
and horrified.</p>

<p>187. COUNCIL ROOM. Enrico, Magistrate, Countess
and Rosalie standing opposite door. They
all look at doorway and see Conwell and Roland.
Rosalie stands transfixed with her eyes wide
open.</p>

<p>188. HALL IN PALACE. Roland stands transfixed,
looking at Rosalie. Conwell invites him in with
a sinister smile and enters first, followed by Roland,
who is followed by the two guards.</p>

<p>189. COUNCIL ROOM. Conwell enters, followed by
Roland and two guards. Conwell crosses to
Rosalie but Roland stops near door, with guards
back of him almost in doorway. Conwell takes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
Rosalie&#39;s hand, tells her Roland is to be their
best man and, looking tauntingly at Roland, he
leans over and kisses her. This infuriates Roland
so he cannot contain himself. He suddenly
whirls, pushes the two guards in the face. They
fall through the door out into the hall. Roland
quickly closes the door.</p>

<p>190. HALL IN PALACE. The two guards fall
through the doorway, sprawling on the floor.</p>

<p>191. COUNCIL ROOM. Roland closes the door and
locks it, turns and rushes upon the astonished
Conwell. Then follows a general mixup. Roland
having to fight Conwell, Enrico and possibly
the Magistrate&mdash;or the Magistrate might be an
old guy who beats it out the window as soon
as the fight begins. Rosalie tries to help by
picking up a vase or some such object and hitting
Conwell or Enrico, but the Countess stops her
and Rosalie keeps the Countess busy by struggling
with all her might. Conwell must be put
out completely and Roland conquers Enrico and
the Magistrate and would be a complete winner
but for the Countess. While she is struggling
with Rosalie and the fight is going on, the
guards in the hall struggle to their feet and begin
banging on the door. The Countess hears this
and her object is to get the door open. She is
prevented for some time by Rosalie but just as
Roland has finished off Conwell and the Magistrate
and has Enrico down and practically out,
the Countess manages to get the door open and
let in the two guards. They cover Roland and
he rises and surrenders. Conwell and Enrico are
pretty far gone but they manage to get up and
Enrico says to the guards:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;TAKE HIM TO THE COURTYARD AND
SHOOT HIM!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The guards rush Roland out&mdash;Rosalie collapses.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">During this fight we see a long shot of Tom
with an American flag and the marines coming
down the street.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">A man running to a group of the populace and
saying: &quot;The Americans are coming!&quot; The
whole of this group then run out toward the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
palace. This group runs to the crowd in front
of the palace and yell: &quot;The Americans are
coming!&quot; The crowd falls back to the other
side of the Plaza and the soldiers guarding the
palace look anxiously up and down.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom with his marines rushes into the plaza.
The crowd falls back and the soldier guards beat
it hot foot. Part of the marines rush into the
palace, led by Tom. The man with the flag and
the rest of them stop outside and guard the
palace.</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Also, during this fight the officer and his guard
of six men take the King and Councilors out
of their cells and lead them off toward the courtyard,
line them up against the wall, tie their
hands behind them, blindfold each one and are
just about to give the order to shoot when Tom
rushes into the courtyard with his marines, who
chase the soldiers off and Tom picks up the
King and carries him and shoos them all before
him into the palace, having jerked off their blindfolds.</p>

<p>192. HALLWAY OF PALACE. Just as the two
guards bring Roland out of the Council Room into
the hall and start toward the stairs, Tom runs in at
front with his marines. The guards, seeing them,
drop Roland and beat it out the back window.
Roland greets Tom ecstatically, looks at his
watch, sees that it is one-half minute to ten and
says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;TRY AND SAVE THE KING AND COUNCIL!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom wants to know where they are and Roland
points down stairs and back. Roland tells twenty
of the marines to come with him and the rest
run down stairs with Tom. Roland leads his
little bunch into the council room.</p>

<p>193. COUNCIL ROOM. Countess is holding up Rosalie,
Conwell leaning against the wall side of
her.  Magistrate is starting marriage service.
Enrico is sitting on the table holding his head
and watching the ceremony. The door bursts
open and in rushes Roland with six marines. He
rushes over and grasps Rosalie and tells the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
marines to cover all the others, which they do.</p>

<p>194. COURTYARD OF PALACE. Officers just finishing
blindfolding King and Councilors. They
are all lined up to be shot. Firing squad is all
ready&mdash;sixteen in all, now. Officer leaves King
and Councilors and takes place at end of firing
squad. He is just about to raise his sword when
Tom runs in from the Palace, lets out a yell,
and followed by his twenty marines rushes in.
The soldiers seeing them, run like mad, chased
by the marines. Tom quickly jerks off blindfolds
and shoos the whole bunch&mdash;King and Councilors&mdash;into
the palace.</p>

<p>195. COUNCIL ROOM. Colonel Bird and two marines
run in. Rosalie rushes to her father&#39;s arms
and Roland tells Bird to look after her and to
go into the hall, which they do. He tells two
of the marines to guard Conwell and the Countess
and Magistrate. He then grabs Enrico, tells the
other six marines to follow, and drags Enrico
out into the hall, followed by six marines.</p>

<p>196. HALLWAY IN PALACE. Colonel Bird and
Rosalie are waiting. Roland drags Enrico out,
followed by six marines. They start toward the
front. At this moment the King and Council
come up the stairs headed by Tom. Roland grabs
the King in his other hand, calls Tom and tells
him to bring the King along; hands him over to
Tom. Tells the marines to herd along the
Council, and they all go toward front of hall.</p>

<p>197. FRONT OF THE PALACE. People waiting.
American soldiers there. Roland and Tom drag
the King and Enrico out on the porch, followed
by Bird and Marines. The people become silent,
not knowing what has happened.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP OF ROLAND STARTING SPEECH. He
raises his hand while Tom holds the King. He
points at the King, then turns and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;MY FRIENDS, FOR TEN YEARS YOUR
BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY HAS BEEN RULED
BY THIS COMIC OPERA KING, WHO HAS
NOT DRAWN A SOBER BREATH SINCE
HE ASCENDED THE THRONE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Tom holds up the King, to whom Roland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
points&mdash;the King weakly protesting. Roland
turns front and speaks again, pointing at Enrico:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;LAST NIGHT THE KING WAS DETHRONED
BY THE MOST CORRUPT AND
CONTEMPTIBLE GRAFTER THE COUNTRY
HAS EVER KNOWN&mdash;ENRICO DE
CASTANET!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He points at Enrico, who grits his teeth and
wants to pounce on Roland, but is restrained
by guns of marines at his back. Roland looks
triumphantly at Enrico, then front, and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;THE FIRST ACT OF THIS TYRANT, ON
ASSUMING POWER, WAS TO RAISE THE
ALREADY EXORBITANT TAXES!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The people nod their heads &quot;yes&quot; and shake
their fists at Enrico. Roland points to Enrico
and says, &quot;Look at him.&quot; He then turns to the
King and says &quot;Look at him.&quot; Then he turns
to the people and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;IS EITHER OF THESE WRETCHES FIT
TO RULE THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY?&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The people shake their heads yelling &quot;No, no,&quot;
and to-helling both the King and Enrico.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP OF ROLAND listening to this demonstration,
turning first to the King and then to Enrico,
as if to say &quot;Ah, you see,&quot; and then front again
and says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;IN AMERICA WE CHOOSE OUR OWN
RULERS AND DETERMINE OURSELVES
WHAT OUR TAXES ARE TO BE.&quot;</p>

<p>LONG SHOT OF THE CROWD&mdash;Hearing this, turning
to each other and expressing their approval of
the idea, one or two yelling out exclamations of
approval.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP OF ROLAND&mdash;Smiling, looking again at
the men on his right and left and again speaking
front:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WHY NOT CHANGE THIS GOVERNMENT
INTO A <i>DEMOCRACY</i> LIKE AMERICA
AND ALL THE <i>CIVILIZED</i> COUNTRIES
OF THE WORLD?&quot;</p>

<p>LONG SHOT OF THE CROWD, yelling approval, waving
their hats and hands and (fade out).</p>

<p>T: AND SO A NEW REPUBLIC WAS BORN.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
THEY TRIED TO MAKE ROLAND PRESIDENT,
BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE JOB
HE WANTED.</p>

<p>198. FADE IN JUDGE&#39;S COURT. Roland is sitting
on the bench all dolled up in a judge&#39;s rig. Beside
him stands Tom in a policeman&#39;s uniform.
He indicates to Tom to bring in the prisoners.
Tom tells an officer to open the door.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP OF DOOR AT SIDE OF ROOM. Officer
opens door and the King and four Councilors
and Enrico file past the camera going to the
front of the Judge&#39;s bench.</p>

<p>LONG SHOT OF COURTROOM, showing prisoners,
Judge and Tom.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP OF ROLAND looking over the prisoners
and saying:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;YOU ARE ALL SENTENCED TO ONE
YEAR IN PRISON&mdash;THIS COUNTRY MUST
BE MADE SAFE FOR DEMOCRACY AND
INSURANCE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">The prisoners all look at each other in dismay.
Tom steps down, starts to jerk Enrico roughly
toward the door. Roland raises his hand and
speaks:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;TREAT THEM GENTLY, CHIEF. THEIR
POLICIES DON&#39;T EXPIRE FOR ELEVEN
MONTHS!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">Then Tom takes them very gently and leads
them out of the room. As they go out, Roland
says:</p>

<p>SP: &quot;WE&#39;LL CALL THAT A DAY. COURT IS
ADJOURNED!&quot;</p>

<p class="indentedmargin">He leaves by door at back.</p>

<p>199. GARDEN. Rosalie waiting. Roland comes to
her. (Fade out.)</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
